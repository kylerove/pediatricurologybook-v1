  <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
  <p>Disorders of sex development (DSD) are  a complex group of anomalies affecting the internal and external  genitalia.&nbsp; Because they tend to be both complicated and rare, management  is best done by a regional team of experts, who can maintain their expertise by  frequent exposure.&nbsp; The paediatric urologist is an essential part of this  team, and can contribute to understanding the normal and abnormal embryology,  as well as the genital anatomy at presentation, particularly in the physical  diagnosis of the disorder.&nbsp; This chapter outlines these various areas  along with the principles of surgical management.&nbsp; For a comprehensive treatise on DSD the  reader is referred to our book on DSD (<em>Hutson,  Warne and Grover, 2012).</em></p>
  <p><strong><u>Normal  Embryology</u></strong> <br>
    During early embryonic development the  urogenital ridge forms from the intermediate mesoderm as a longitudinal  protrusion on the posterior wall of the pleuroperitoneal cavity (1,2).&nbsp;  Originally a few tubules form at the end of the urogenital ridge and then  almost immediately regress as the transient pronephros.&nbsp; By the time the  diaphragm forms to create the abdominal cavity the mesonephros or middle kidney  has developed and has taken over the lower half of the pronephric duct, so it  becomes the mesonephric or Wolffian duct.&nbsp; On the anteromedial surface of  the mesonephros the mesenchyme condenses to form the ambisexual gonad, into  which the primitive germ cells migrate from the caudal yolk sac stalk in the  region of the allantois.&nbsp; Near the cranial pole of the gonad the  peritoneal surface over the lateral free edge of the urogenital ridge  evaginates to form the paramesonephric or M&uuml;llerian duct, which then elongates  caudally to the cloaca following the Wolffian duct.&nbsp; Caudally the  urogenital ridges roll medially so that their free edges , each with a contained  M&uuml;llerian duct,<br>
come into apposition with each other,  allowing the ducts to fuse, to create the uterovaginal primordium.&nbsp; The  caudal end of the fused ducts, which is a solid cord, migrates to the anterior  cloaca between the Wolffian ducts to stimulate proliferation of the bulb  endoderm to form the sinovaginal bulb.&nbsp; In females further proliferation  of this endoderm caudally extends the uterovaginal primordium to the outside,  immediately behind the primitive urethra.</p>
  <p>Sexual development of the internal  genitalia beginsat 7-8 weeks&rsquo; gestation.SRY expression in males triggers a  cascade of differentiation in the ambisexual gonad to form a testis (3).&nbsp;  Early production of anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH; also called M&uuml;llerian  Inhibiting Substance, MIS) causes regression of the M&uuml;llerian ducts, while  testosterone from the Leydig cells is secreted as an exocrine hormone down the  Wolffian ducts to trigger their development into epididymis cranially, vas  deferens caudally and budding of the distal Wolffian duct to produce the  seminal vesicle (4).&nbsp; Testosterone also enters the blood as an endocrine  hormone to reach the external genitalia, where it is converted by an enzyme, 5alpha-reductase,  into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (5).&nbsp; DHT binds 5-10 times more tightly to  androgen receptors than testosterone itself, thereby functioning as a  concentrating mechanism for androgenic action at a time when the developing  testis is still tiny and the blood level of testosterone is low.</p>
  <p>Circulating androgens, via DHT,  masculinise the external genitalia at 8-12 weeks.&nbsp; The genital tubercle enlarges into a penis,  while the endodermal urethral plate canalises to form a urethra that extends  initially to the future coronal groove (~ 12 weeks) and eventually to the tip  of the glans (~15-20 weeks).&nbsp; The inner and outer genital folds grow over  the urethral plate to form the periurethral tissues and scrotum, and the  uterovaginal primordium is stimulated to regress.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In addition, circulating androgens  cause regression of the cranial suspensory ligament of the gonad.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The developing Leydig cells also  produce insulin-like hormone 3 (Insl3), which stimulates the caudal suspensory  ligament of the urogenital ridge, known as the genito-inguinal ligament or  &ldquo;gubernaculum&rdquo; (6-8).&nbsp; The gubernaculum ends in the anterior abdominal  wall just lateral to the developing <em>Rectus  abdominis</em> muscle.&nbsp; Its caudal end enlarges in the male in response to  Insl3.&nbsp; In addition, its attachment to  the urogenital ridge and lower pole of the gonad (known as the cord) remains  short and thick, thereby anchoring the testis to the future inguinal canal as  the fetal abdominal cavity enlarges with growth (9).&nbsp; This anchoring of  the fetal testis between 8 and 15 weeks of gestation causes the first or  transabdominal phase of descent.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>At about 25 weeks&rsquo; gestation the fetal  testis starts to descend as part of the inguino-scrotal phase of  descent.Migration to the scrotum requires the gubernaculum to elongate beyond  the external inguinal ring, across the pubic region and into the scrotum,  probably controlled by the genitofemoral nerve.&nbsp; The latter is regulated  by androgens, which stimulate release of a neurotransmitter, calcitonin  gene-related peptide (CGRP), from the sensory branches of the nerve to provide  a chemical gradient for the gubernaculum to follow.&nbsp; After descent is  complete CGRP also regulates obliteration of the proximal processus vaginalis  to prevent inguinal hernia.</p>
  <p>In females genital development proceeds  initially without hormones.Absence of AMH allows the M&uuml;llerian ducts to  differentiate into Fallopian tubes, uterus and upper vagina, while lack of  testosterone not only allows the external genitalia to retain their female  shape but also allows </p>
  vaginal development and  canalisation.&nbsp; Without androgens the urethral plate of the future clitoris  undergoes apoptosis, thereby shortening the ventral surface to produce the  natural hair-pin typical of mature clitoral anatomy (10).&nbsp; The regressing  mesonephros leaves the gonads on a mesentery, which in females becomes a  substantial structure as the mesovarium and the rest of the urogenital ridge  develops into the broad-ligament, to anchor the female genital tract in the  pelvis (11).Absence of Insl3 in the developing ovary allows the female  gubernaculum to elongate in proportion to fetal growth, to eventually become  the ligament of the ovary and the round ligament.

  <p><strong><u>Abnormal  Embryology</u></strong></p>
  <p>Failure of testicular differentiation  interferes with the hormones that control sexual differentiation (12).&nbsp;  Where the anomaly affects the amount of testicular hormones, the degree of  masculinisation, both internally and externally, is proportional to the functional  levels of testosterone, AMH and Insl3 that are produced.&nbsp; The amount of  effective androgenic signalling (via DHT) can be determined from the external  genitalia, which are in effect a &ldquo;bioassay&rdquo; for androgen (13).<br>
In complex chromosomal anomalies, such  as aneuploidy and mosaicism, there may be asymmetrical testicular  development.&nbsp; In sex chromosome mosaicism the gonadal differentiation is  determined by the number of cells in the ambisexual gonad that contain a Y  chromosome, with normal SRY expression.&nbsp;  It is common for the percentage of cells containing a Y chromosome to  vary in each urogenital ridge, so that &lsquo;testicular&rsquo; development may occur only  on one side.&nbsp; Because the internal  genital ducts respond to exocrine hormones from the ipsilateral testis the  Wolffian duct will be preserved on the side of a testis, while the M&uuml;llerian  duct will be absent on this same side.&nbsp; As the testes control their own  descent (via Insl3, AMH and testosterone), ductal asymmetry is paired with  asymmetrical testicular descent in newborns with mixed gonadal dysgenesis (45  X/46XY, with a streak gonad on one side and a testis on the other) and  ovotesticular DSD (where there may be a testis on one side and ovary on the  other, or various combinations of ovotestes).<br>
<br>
<br>
Placental insufficiency can cause  ambiguous genitalia.&nbsp; In the past these  anomalies were invisible because of fetal death <em>in utero</em> or early postnatal deaths in extremely premature  newborns.&nbsp; The effects of placental  insufficiency are now seen in some surviving males born at 24-26 weeks&rsquo;  gestation with severe intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR), where early  production of testicular hormones wasthought to be impeded by the lack of  chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (5) from the abnormal placenta.&nbsp; The baby  has IUGR and ambiguous genitalia with partially descended testes, but no other  hormonal anomaly after birth.&nbsp; The growth  failure prenatally means that many of these boys are tiny, and although catch-up  growth occurs during childhood, some need growth hormone.</p>
  <p>Abnormalities of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis cause micropenis and cryptorchidism.&nbsp; In these disorders the infant has fully  masculinised external genitalia (8-12 weeks) but failure of phallic growth  between 15 and 40 weeks, leading to micropenis (14).&nbsp; This is because  initial sexual differentiation is normal as the developing testis is stimulated  by hCG from the placenta until the hypothalamic axis takes over at about 15  weeks of gestation.&nbsp; This leads to normal circulating androgens between 8  and 15 weeks, but deficient androgens thereafter.&nbsp; The two remaining features of masculine  anatomy that develop after this, i.e. phallic enlargement and inguinoscrotal  testicular descent, are the only things deranged.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Androgen function is disturbed by a number  of specific enzymatic and receptor mutations.A classic example is the patient  with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), where the androgen  receptor is non-functional (19).&nbsp; External genital anatomy is that of a  normal female apart from the presence of testes in the inguinal region (inside the  inguinal canal or just &nbsp;outside the  external inguinal ring), as the first phase of testicular descent is normal  while the second phase is completely blocked.&nbsp; In addition, AMH function  is normal so that the M&uuml;llerian ducts have regressed even though lower vaginal  development is normal, as the uterovaginal primordium forms in the absence of  androgens (20, 21).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Specific mutations in enzymes or  receptors controlling the other testicular hormones cause &nbsp;isolated anatomical derangements.&nbsp; Insl3 synthesis  or Insl3 receptor anomalies, for example, would produce undescended testes, but  these are rare.&nbsp; However, endocrine disruptors in the maternal environment  may account for some cases, as exogenous oestrogens suppress Insl3.&nbsp; Mutations in AMH signalling also lead to a  rare syndrome, known as persisting M&uuml;llerian duct syndrome (PMDS) (15-17).&nbsp;  In this abnormality external genital development is normal male but the testes  are undescended and the M&uuml;llerian ducts persist as an infantile uterus, tubes  and upper vagina (entering the posterior urethra near the verumontanum).&nbsp;  The cause for cryptorchidism is debated, and many authors suggest that the  retained uterus and broad ligaments prevent descent (18).&nbsp; The cord of the  gubernaculum, however, is abnormally long, suggesting that AMH has some role in  preventing gubernacular cord elongation, at least in humans, as this is not  seen in rodents (15-17).&nbsp; An important corollary of the link between AMH  and testicular descent is the fact that when transabdominal descent of the  testis has occurred (so that the testis is palpable), we can confidently  predict that the M&uuml;llerian duct (on that side) is regressed (13).</p>
  When the external genital  anomaly is outside the narrow spectrum from normal female to normal male or the  adjacent perineum is abnormal, the baby does not have a hormonal abnormality  but instead has a complex morphological anomaly of the perineum (12).&nbsp;  This range of anomalies is familiar to surgeons, and includes bladder and  cloacal exstrophy, ectopic or absent scrotum or penis and many anorectal malformations  with cutaneous, bulbar or vestibular fistulae(2).
  <p><strong><u>Clinical Examination  and Rules for Diagnosis</u></strong> <br>
The clinical examination of a baby with  suspected DSD includes a careful history of the pregnancy and the family.&nbsp; The family history may reveal an inherited  anomaly with an autosomal recessive or x-linked pattern, such as in androgen  insensitivity.&nbsp; Possible prenatal factors  in the mother or her environment (e.g. steroid ingestion, hormone-secreting tumours,  placental dysfunction) may also interfere with sexual development in the fetus.</p>
  <p>The physical examination of the  genitalia requires a number of features to be determined, using some simple rules  derived from our knowledge of normal and abnormal development (Table 1) (13).&nbsp;  Clearly a general examination will include a search for other anomalies and  possible syndromic features, as a number of malformation syndromes are  associated with DSD (40).&nbsp; The genital  examination should concentrate on the following:</p>
  <p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  establish degree of masculinisation, which is easily done using the Prader  Score from 0 to 5 (Prader scale: O: normal female appearance; 1-4: increasing  masculinisation; 5: normal male appearance).&nbsp; This determines the amount  of active androgen the baby was exposed to,as the degree of virilisation is directly  proportional to the amount of androgen signalling.&nbsp; It also predicts the amount of lower vaginal  regression, although some authors have disputed this (22).<br>
      <br>
    (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; determine the site, shape and  contents of the urogenital opening.&nbsp; The labio-scrotal folds should be  pulled open to examine the urogenital sinus.&nbsp; In boys with simple  hypospadias, not only is the scrotum fused and contains two descended testes,  but the urethral meatus is usually tiny.&nbsp; By contrast, in babies with a  DSD causing androgen insufficiency the urogenital opening is a funnel-shaped  opening.&nbsp; At the apex of this funnel it may be possible to see the  urethral and vaginal confluence, which is marked by the hymen.&nbsp; The latter  is easily recognised as its mucosa is a slightly paler bluish-pink colour in  contrast to the bright red urethral mucosa.&nbsp; The pale blue colour of the  hymen at birth is a result of stimulation by maternal oestrogens.&nbsp; If a hymen can be seen then we can deduce the  presence of the lower vagina persisting from the vaginal plate.</p>
  <p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  determine the presence and site of the gonads, which, if present, are  testes.&nbsp; Palpation of any testis will not only confirm its normal (or  abnormal) consistency, but also will identify any epididymis or vas  deferens.&nbsp; Where testes are not palpable, you should palpate the site of  the external inguinal ring.&nbsp; If this is palpable as a triangular defect,  then it is highly likely that there is a testis present inside the inguinal  canal.&nbsp; By contrast, if the ring is completely closed the gonad is  unlikely to be inside the canal, and it suggests that it is intra-abdominal,  either as a very dysplastic or dysgenetic testis/streak gonad or is simply an  ovary (which never descends as it lacks the testicular hormones that control  descent).&nbsp; When an inguinal hernia  contains an ovary in a girl, it has been pulled into a sliding hernia rather  than &lsquo;descended&rsquo; like a testis (Hutson&nbsp;  &amp; Kearsey, JPS in press).</p>
  <p>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  determine the state of the internal ducts by rectal examination to palpate a  cervix and/or arrange an ultrasonogram of the pelvis to see if ovaries and  female ducts can be seen.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Surgical Management</u></strong> <br>
The surgical treatment of the genital  anomalies present in DSD requires a high degree of expertise.&nbsp; Not only does the surgery itself need  considerable skill in reconstructive procedures but also because the outcome  must be good enough to withstand critical adult appraisal half a lifetime later  (23, 24)!&nbsp; After the discovery of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in 1953,  there was an explosion in new techniques to treat DSD, but many procedures  devised in the 1960&rsquo;s, <br>
1970&rsquo;s and 1980&rsquo;s had a relatively poor  cosmetic and functional outcome when that cohort of patients reached adulthood (25).&nbsp;  This led to the establishment of many patient support groups and some public  backlash against amateurish surgical efforts, leading in some places in the  world to a moratorium on genital surgery in infants (26, 27).&nbsp; However, this period of &lsquo;trial and error&rsquo; is  a natural part of the learning curve in surgery, so initial poor outcomes  should be the stimulus for advancement, rather than abandonment of treatment. </p>
  <p>Poor initial long-term outcomes  triggered a radical reappraisal of management, with the establishment of  regional centres of excellence to allow accumulation and maintenance of  expertise and multidisciplinary skills.&nbsp; As in many aspects of paediatric  surgery, the basic problem here was the long lag-time between the intervention  (surgery in early childhood/infancy) and the functional, cosmetic and mental  outcome measured in adulthood and the ability of these people to have a  satisfying sex life.&nbsp; In the first 20-30 years of DSD surgery there was no  major adult feedback except for anecdotal cases, but this has now been replaced  with increasingly formalised follow-up studies, so that the best aspects of  different approaches can be assimilated into a common management plan (28, 29,  39).</p>
  <p>In our own institution the first long-term  review was done in the 1980&rsquo;s and this identified a number of important issues,  as listed below.<br>
    i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  children had nightmares about frequent (and often public) genital examination, in  outpatient clinic, so we immediately altered practice to obtain informed  consent (from the child, if possible) and appropriate privacy and discretion.&nbsp; Currently we only do a genital examination  later in childhood if there is an indication.&nbsp; <br>
    (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Postoperative vaginal dilatations were traumatic (both physically and mentally)  for children and parents, and were probably unnecessary if surgical healing was  achieved without sepsis.&nbsp; We stopped this  in the 1980&rsquo;s, and developed more aggressive preventive measures against  perineal wound infection (antibiotic cover, antiseptic ointment and salt  baths).<br>
    (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  regular follow-up by the operating surgeon provided invaluable moral support  for children growing up as they had regular contact with the person who knew  the most about their diagnosis and anatomy.&nbsp;  This remains an important part of our current treatment plan.<br>
    (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  early exposure (during childhood) to the adolescent gynaecologist was a great  help for both parents and girls with DSD, as transition to adult care was  facilitated by an unbroken chain.&nbsp; We  currently introduce our female patients to the adolescent gynaecologist at about  9-11 years of age.<br>
    (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  open disclosure not only demystified the medical complexities of the diagnosis  but also enabled DSD to be managed like any other chronic medical problem,  rather than something secretive and shameful or a freak of nature.&nbsp; We  started with disclosure to parents, and quickly appreciated that the sooner  children begin to understand the underlying issues the less disturbed their  personality development will be.&nbsp; Open  discussion of the problem with age-specific vocabulary occurs throughout  childhood, leading up to more formal explanations of the biology in late  childhood or early adolescence. <br>
    (vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ongoing counselling, both informal and formal was an absolute necessity, based  on our increasing awareness of the brain as the most important organ of  sexuality.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Timing</u></strong> <br>
Despite the debate in many centres  about avoiding irreversible surgery in infancy (see Garry Warne&rsquo;s accompanying  chapter) we continue to offer early intervention with fully-informed consent,  if that is the parents&rsquo; wish.&nbsp; This is  because long-term follow up shows that only about 12% of girls need further  surgery in adolescence (presented at the International DSD meeting, Gent, Belgium,  June 2015).</p>
  <p>For female genitoplasty, we currently recommend  surgery between 6 weeks and 6 months (30).&nbsp; This allows time for full  diagnostic workup and counselling, without parents feeling that they are being  pushed into it.&nbsp; The clitoromegaly recedes somewhat after the commencement  of cortisone, and the secondary suppression of abnormal androgen  production.&nbsp; By a few months little  further shrinkage will occur and surgery is used to reduce the clitoris to the  correct size.&nbsp; Beyond 9-12 months other  factors coming into play, such as the baby crawling and walking, which risks  trauma to the genitalia postoperatively if there is a fall (which is common!).&nbsp;  In addition, the tissues are easy to work with at this age, and healing is rapid,  as long as superficial infection and wound breakdown can be avoided by adequate  perioperative perineal toilet.</p>
  <p>For boys we usually begin  reconstruction between 3 and 6 months, so further stages can be done (and  hopefully completed) by 18 months of age, when permanent memories of admission  to hospital and genital surgery may be an issue.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Female Genitoplasty</u></strong> <br>
Surgical reconstruction, most commonly  for babies with CAH, includes 3 basic principles (31-34).<br>
&nbsp; <br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Clitoroplasty to reduce excess erectile tissue of the corpora cavernosa and  reducing the size of the glans, while preserving the neurovascular supply so  that subsequent sexual function is as close to normal as possible.&nbsp; There  are numerous methods for clitoroplasty but we have continued to use a  modification of the method first used in our department by Robert Fowler in the  early 1970&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This technique removes  excess ventral erectile tissue and recreates the normal hairpin bend in the  clitoris, and avoids any dissection on the dorsal surface near the  neurovascular bundles (35) (Figure 1SHOULD THIS BE FIGURE C-I, INSTEAD??).&nbsp;  Our results continue to support this approach against the alternative method of  isolation of the neurovascular bundles to allow excision of the shaft of the  phallus:&nbsp; the latter method has a greater risk of glans ischaemia or sensory  loss which would seriously compromise adult sexual function (24, 29).&nbsp; The  only good argument against our approach is the risk of enlargement of the  corpora cavernosa in adolescence if the steroid suppression lapses. </p>
  <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Creation of a normal-looking introitus with labia minora and labia  majora.&nbsp; Although this seems like &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; cosmetic surgery, this is in  fact one of the key steps in the surgery, as the external appearance is used by  the patient herself (as well as everyone else, including potential male  partners) as a measure of &ldquo;normality&rdquo;.&nbsp; The outer foreskin hood around the  clitoris is partly used to create labia minora while the inner foreskin is left  as a covering for the newly reconstructed clitoral glans (36).FIGURE I-L</p>
  <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The third aim of the genital reconstruction is a vaginoplasty, to provide an  adequate opening in the introitus for the vagina (37, 38).&nbsp; This prevents  urine pooling in the vagina if the common urogenital sinus is left intact, as  well as allows normal tampon use in adolescence, with or without some minor  patient-controlled dilatation at that time.&nbsp; There are many approaches to  vaginoplasty, from simple Y-V plasty to Passerini operation (38), but we have  found no need to do complex operations, as long as the V-flap is inserted high  enough on the posterior vaginal wall to relieve the androgen-induced stenosis  of the lower third of the vagina (29, 35).&nbsp; In addition, it is extremely  rare in CAH patients for the confluence of the vagina with the urogenital sinus  to encroach on the sphincter zone of the urethra.&nbsp; Only in the exceptional  cases (with extreme virilisation, Prader V) has a Passerini-Glazel procedure or  a pull-through been required.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Male Genitoplasty</u></strong> <br>
Boys with ambiguous genitalia have  severe hypospadias, and a staged reconstruction is helpful here.&nbsp; The  principles of hypospadias repair hardly need emphasis in this chapter, as they  are similar to that elsewhere in this text.&nbsp; However, there are a few minor  differences worth a mention.</p>
  <p>During the first procedure, endoscopy  is helpful to identify and document the site and size of a retained lower vaginal  remnant, as this may need to be excised if it is likely to store urine after  distal urethroplasty.&nbsp; Also, laparoscopy may be required to document  precisely the internal anatomy and/or excise a streak gonad.&nbsp; We have also  used laparoscopy to detach the vaginal remnant from the urethra but without  excision, so that the early hypospadias repair is not compromised by pooling  urine in the vagina and secondary sepsis, but the options are left open in the  future for gender change, should this occur.</p>
  <p>Also during the first operation the  chordee is released in the standard fashion, and orchidopexy and/or hernia repair  can be performed.&nbsp; In addition a gonadal  biopsy may be needed. </p>
  <p>After a 6 month interval we would  proceed to urethroplasty and correction of the penoscrotal transposition, along  with repair of the bifid scrotum.&nbsp; Also,in some patients the connection  between the vaginal remnant and urogenital sinus is so low it can be reached  easily from the perineum by opening the anterior part of the perineal  body.&nbsp; The vaginal remnant can be excised completely or disconnected and  left <em>in situ</em>, and sometimes excision  of the mucosa is sufficient.&nbsp; The latter is relatively simple, and  decreases the risk of inadvertent damage to the rectum.</p>

  <p><strong>Fig. A.&nbsp; </strong>Relative anatomy of normal female versus virilised female in CAH, with  masculinisation of anterior urethra pushing opening on perineum forward, even  though join between urogenital sinus and vagina remains quite close to surface.&nbsp; <strong>B</strong>.&nbsp;  Marking the skin flaps for (V-Y) vaginoplasty using a sound to mark the  posterior limit of the masulinised urogenital sinus.&nbsp; This marks the base of the skin flap so that  it aligns with the vagina and the posterior limit of the labio-scrotal  folds.&nbsp; <strong>C.</strong>&nbsp; Skin incisions for clitoroplasty, vaginoplasty, and redundant  labia.&nbsp; <strong>D.</strong>&nbsp; Stay sutures in glans and prepuce.&nbsp; Incision  lines on ventral surface are shown in detail in relation to the ventral mucosal  strip of the urogenital sinus and to vaginoplasty (Y-V).&nbsp; <strong>E.</strong>&nbsp;  Mobilisation of phallic shaft ventrally to free the urogenital mucosal strip  (X) and protect the underlying urethra where it passes between the crura  (Y).&nbsp; &nbsp;Dorsal mobilisation of shaft skin to expose and divide the  suspensory ligament (Z).&nbsp; <strong>F</strong>.&nbsp; Caudal traction on phallus to  expose bifurcation of crura and periosteum of symphysis pubis (W).&nbsp; A  right-angled divulser is pushed through the bifurcation, with care to avoid the  urethra, to apply rubber catheter tourniquets to each crus.&nbsp; <strong>G.</strong>&nbsp;  Tourniquets around each crus, showing mucosal strip and urethra retracted to  safety.&nbsp; <strong>H.</strong>&nbsp; Anterior portion of shaft and glans is excised  with tourniquet control, avoiding the dorsal nerves and vessels.&nbsp; Extra  bulk can be removed by &ldquo;filleting&rdquo; out erectile tissue from the cut  surface.&nbsp; <strong>I.</strong>&nbsp; Suture of phallus into hair-pin bend by  approximating raw surfaces (excluding distal frenular area) and suturing  apposed lateral cut edges of tunica.&nbsp; <strong>J.</strong>&nbsp; Folded phallus  sutured to pubic periosteum.&nbsp; The anterior midline fold of the clitoral  skin is sutured to the shaft.&nbsp; The skin edge (A1) is sutured to the flange  of subcoronal skin (A2).&nbsp; Preputial flaps are sutured along each side of  the re-attached vestibular mucosal strip to simulate labia minora (B1-B2, C1-C2).&nbsp; <strong>K.&nbsp; </strong>The removal of the posterior end of the labioscrotal folds.&nbsp; &nbsp; Final result at end of operation.&nbsp;  The Y-V vaginoplasty flap and excision of redundant labial skin are also shown. </p>
