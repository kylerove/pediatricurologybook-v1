  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
  <p>The biological male without  a penis or with an insufficient penis remains a major challenge. Failure of  penile development, trauma, medically-indicated penile amputations, and failed  reconstructions of congenital anomalies are the main reasons for penile  insufficiency(Table 1). Severe penile insufficiency and absence of a penis are  devastating conditions for men, with significant psychological and physical  impact. Although uncommon, it is a challenging condition to treat.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Treatment options for this devastating condition  are gender reassignment, tailoring of the penile stump, penile reattachment,  phallic reconstruction (phalloplasty), and most recently penile transplantation  (Table 2). <br>
  &nbsp;In the  past, sex reassignment to the female gender had been offered based on the  principles applied to newborns with disorders of sexual differentiation (DSD)  and ambiguous genitalia. There is no evidence to demonstrate that the outcome  of this policy is satisfactory. Indeed, long-term evaluation of a few patients  shows contradictory results, which have triggered great controversy of this  therapy [<a href="#bib1">1</a>]. Some recent reports have alerted physicians to  the high incidence of gender identity disorder in gender reassigned children.  Especially in cloacalexstrophy, the results have been disappointing [<a href="#bib2">2,3</a>]. Today, sex reassignment is no longer considered  treatment of choice. Parents of children presenting with these conditions  should be informed that a phalloplasty can be performedlater in life avoiding  the stressful decision of gender reassignment. </p>

  <p>Tailoring of the penile stump by means of penile  degloving, division of the suspensory ligament, and rotational skin flaps has  been reported [<a href="#bib4">4,5</a>]. However, this can only be applied to  moderate penile injuries where there is still a reasonable penile stump.<br>
    When penile skin is lacking for reconstruction a  reversed mesh graft can be used to cover the penile shaft. Widely meshed  split-thickness skin grafts should never be used on the penile shaft. However,  with the so&#8208;called &igrave;rreversed  mesh graft (i.e. nonexpanded or 1:1 meshed skin grafts) only puncture&#8208;type perforations are made with a V1 carrier (Humeca Ltd., Enschede,  the Netherlands). These allow for a better fluid evacuation and thus a better  skin graft take whilst still avoiding poor scarring and an unaesthetic mesh  pattern in the long-term. These nonexpanded meshed split&#8208;thickness grafts have also become a mainstay of complicated, staged  urethral reconstruction [<a href="#bib6">6,7</a>]. McAninch [<a href="#bib8">8</a>]  has described the use of (not too widely) meshed split-thickness skin grafts  for scrotal reconstruction. Meshed grafts in this location may produce good  esthetic results, but they will never measure up to the functional capacity of  sheet or 1:1 perforated grafts.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In some cases good results can be obtained by  combining techniques (Figure 1).</p>
  <p><img src="/2017/figure1ppl.jpg" width="438" height="330"></p>
  <p><img src="/2017/fig2.jpg" width="604" height="453"></p>
  <p>Figure  1:Example of a cripple penis  where the stump was released and covered with reversed mesh graft</p>
  <p>Penile reattachment can be attempted in the  acute phase following traumatic amputation of the penis. The survival of the  reattached penis depends on the viability of the amputated segment and the  condition of the graft bed or penile stump. Reattachment must take place within  24 hours. Current reattachment techniques rely on microsurgical approximation  of the dorsal structures and cavernosal arteries with uniformly good results.  In traumatic amputation, salvage of the amputated segment with reattachment is  the primary treatment option [<a href="#bib9">9</a>]. The outcome of erectile  function after reattachment is, however, not clear.<br>
    The ideal candidate for genital replantation is  a patient with a clean, sharp cut in which the amputated part has been cooled. </p>
  <p>Recently, two case report has been published on  penile transplantation, one unsuccessful [<a href="#bib10">10</a>] and more  recently a successful case . This technique is still experimental and is not a  current treatment option. Future options, like tissue engineering, are as yet  matters for science fiction rather than science.<br>
    Phallic reconstruction is another treatment  option. The first phallic reconstruction was described by Bogoras in 1936 with  a tubed abdominal flap [<a href="#bib11">11</a>]. Phalloplasty procedures have  followed the evolution and advances made in plastic surgery. Originally, it was  a complex, time-consuming, multistage procedure using tubed skin flaps or  pedicledmyocutaneous flaps with variable and suboptimal results [<a href="#bib12">12-14</a>].<br>
    In 1984, Chang completed the first successful  microsurgical phalloplasty with a radial forearm free flap [<a href="#bib15">15</a>].  Since then, the radial forearm flap has been widely accepted as the best donor  site for penile reconstruction and is nowadays the gold standard in penile  replacement for female-to&#8208;male transsexuals  [<a href="#bib16">16&ndash;18</a>]. This technique can also be applied to boys  without an adequate penis. Defining penile insufficiency is difficult. To base  the definition of inadequacy on length and appearance alone is impossible,  especially in infants and young children. Penile inadequacy is an individual  diagnosis that can only be made after puberty when sexual development is  completed and the patient is sexually active. Puberty can change the final  outcome of penile length and girth substantially. The number of children  diagnosed with micropenis persisting into adulthood is limited [<a href="#bib19">19</a>].<br>
    As for penile reconstruction, many techniques  have been described for penile augmentation. However, the results of most of  these surgeries are very limited, Indeed, the reported outcome is often poor [<a href="#bib20">20</a>].<br>
    In this chapter, we will focus on the  phalloplasty. It is considered the gold standard for penile absence or severe  penile inadequacy, when endocrinological therapy is not beneficial.</p>
  <div><br>
    <strong>Phalloplasty </strong></div>
  <p>Surgical reconstruction  of the penis (phalloplasty) is difficult because of the different cosmetic and  functional requirements of the patients:<br>
    1. The reconstructed penis  should be esthetically acceptable; it must be as normal as possible in  appearance (minimal scar, glandular reconstruction, etc.).<br>
    2. The penile shaft must  contain a urethra that extends to the distal tip and permits the patient to  void in a standing position unless there is a concomitant condition that makes  normal voiding impossible.<br>
    3. The penile shaft should  allow the implantation of a penile stiffener in order to regain the possibility  of sexual intercourse. Therefore, protective and erogenous sensation is needed.<br>
    4. The donor area should cause  minimal morbidity with an acceptable scar that is easy to conceal.<br>
    Many of these objectives could not be obtained  with the older methods in which phallic reconstruction required a complex  multistaged procedure. Nowadays, microvascular free flap techniques come closer  to achieving these objectives. Despite the multitude of free flaps that have  been published (frequently as a case report), the radial forearm free flap is  universally considered the gold standard in penile reconstruction [<a href="#bib16">16&ndash;18</a>,<a href="#bib21">21</a>].<br>
    Surgical technique<br>
    At Ghent University  Hospital, more than 500 consecutive patients have undergone phallic  reconstruction using a radial forearm flap. This experience is mainly in  female-to-male transsexuals. We describe our current technique as well as the  different changes and refinements madein the reconstruction for the biological  male in this radial forearm phalloplasty procedure.<br>
    Depending on the underlying condition, we try to  preserve any useful penile and cavernosal tissue. The urethral stump, if  available, is prepared for connection with the phallic urethra and, also if  available, a dorsal penile nerve is identified. A free vascularized flap of the  forearm and the creation of a phallus with a tube-in&#8208;a&#8208;tube technique is  performed with the flap still attached to the forearm by its vascular pedicle.  A small skin flap and skin graft are used to create a corona and imitate the  glans of the penis.<br>
  <a name="fig1"></a>The free flap is then  transferred to the pubic area where first the urethral anastomosis is  performed. The radial artery is then microsurgically connected to the common  femoral artery in an end-to&#8208;side fashion,  usually with an interpositional vein graft taken at the ankle. The venous  anastomosis is performed between the cephalic vein and the greater saphenous  vein. One forearm nerve is connected to the ilioinguinal nerve for protective  sensation, and the other nerve is anastomosed to one of the dorsal penile  nerves for erogenous sensation. All patients receive a suprapubic urinary  diversion postoperatively.<br>
    In the first 50 patients the defect on the  forearm was covered with full-thickness skin grafts taken from the groin area;  later, patients were given split&#8208;thickness skin grafts harvested from the medial and anterior thigh.<br>
    The patients remain in bed for one week after  which the transurethral catheter is removed. Three to five days later the  suprapubic catheter is clamped and voiding is started. It sometimes takes  several days before good voiding is observed. The average admission period for  the phalloplasty procedure is approximately 2.5 weeks.<br>
    Tattooing of the glans can be performed after a  2&ndash;3 month period, before sensation returns to the penis (Figure <a href="#fig1">27.4</a>).<br>
    The development of perforator flaps has given  rise to some new reconstructive options in patients with severe (congenital)  penile insufficiency. Perforator flaps have the advantage of reducing the donor  site morbidity, increasing the range of motion and combining different tissue  flaps on one single pedicle. Although &ndash; overall &ndash; the free vascularized radial forearm flap described above is still  considered as the &ldquo;standard technique&rdquo; in penile reconstruction, the pedicledantero&#8208;lateral thigh (ALT) flap has been shown to  provide a valuable phalloplasty alternative specifically in patients with  congenital penile insufficiency. This flap is a skin flap based on a perforator  from the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, which is a  branch from the femoral artery. There are several reasons why in boys without a  penis a pedicled ALT flap can be preferred above the standard radial forearm  flap :<br>
    a pedicled flap reconstruction  (the flap has a sufficiently long pedicle) avoids the technically more complex  microscopic procedure and might also shorten the operation time<br>
    A visible donor site scar on  the forearm, often considered as the signature of female-to&#8208;male transsexualism, is avoided and the donor site on the leg can more  easily be concealed.<br>
    Previous reconstructive  surgeries at the pelvis, groin area and lower abdomen (e.g. in case of bladder  exstrophy) might have altered the local anatomy and vasculature making a  microsurgical anastomosis more difficult.<br>
    The subcutaneous fat layer is  much thinner than in a (biologically female) trans-man, facilitating the  (urethral)tube-within&#8208;a&#8208;(penile)tube reconstruction of the penis; moreover, many exstrophy  patients empty their bladder by catheterization through a continent diversion  (e.g. appendico&#8208;vesicostomy) and  don't require a urethral reconstruction in their phalloplasty. An ejaculatory  opening can be left at the ventral aspect just above the scrotum.<br>
    It is very important to preserve and incorporate  any useful glandular, penile and cavernosal tissue at the basis of the  newly-reconstructed phallus in order to facilitate sexual stimulation and  pleasure (Figure 27.5d). If available, a dorsal penile nerve is identified and  connected with a cutaneous nerve of the flap; if not available, the lateral  femoral cutaneous nerve is connected to the ilioinguinal nerve.<br>
    Usually, it is recommended to perform a 3D angio  CT-scan preoperatively to provide detailed information on the perforator  vessel(s) and the subcutaneous tissue layer.</p>
  <p><strong>Sexual function</strong></p>
  <p>Sexual function and  pleasure is one of the goals in phallic reconstruction. For this purpose, in  biological males any sensitive penile tissue left must be incorporated. Any  glans tissue present can be incorporated in the base of the neophallus. This is  important for sexual stimulation and pleasure. Further erogenous and tactile  sensations of the neophallus are obtained by microscopic anastomosis of,  respectively, one dorsal phallic nerve and one ilioinguinal nerve to the  cutaneous nerves of the flap [<a href="#bib22">22</a>].<br>
    Obtaining sufficient rigidity of the penis to  allow penetration is extremely difficult because there is no good substitute  for the unique erectile tissue of the penis. The radial forearm flap is too  soft and can even demonstrate some atrophy of the subcutaneous fat with a loss  of more than 20% of circumference. The use of bone or cartilage grafts has  often resulted in complications and failure because of resorption, curving, or  fracture [<a href="#bib23">23&ndash;24</a>]. For sexual penetration, a penile  stiffener is needed and, fortunately, the radial forearm flap has sufficient  subcutaneous bulk to permit incorporation of a penile prosthesis. Incorporation  of a penile stiffener can only be done after the phallus is endowed with  sufficient protective sensation, which usually takes at least 12 months. Good  protective sensation is critical in preventing breakdown and erosion of an  internal stiffener [<a href="#bib25">25&ndash;26</a>]. Next to sensitivity, urethral  function also has to be considered. Implantation of a penile prosthesis must be  withheld until the urethra is stable, and the patient is free of voiding  symptoms and urinary tract infection [<a href="#bib25">25</a>].<br>
    Unfortunately, high erosion rates (20&ndash;50%) are  reported [<a href="#bib16">16</a>,<a href="#bib25">25</a>]. One of the reasons  could be the less vascularized skin and subcutaneous tissue of the neophallus  (in comparison with a native impotent penis), which can lead to chronic  ischemia after implantation of a stiffener and subsequently diminished  resistance against infection and perforation.<br>
    Despite the complications and difficulties, the  satisfaction rate after phalloplasty is high and the results cosmetically  pleasing (Figure 1). None of our patients regret the surgery. An important  boost concerning the self-esteem level is observed in each patient, which is a  very important outcome factor postoperatively.</p>

  <p><strong>Complications</strong></p>
  <p>Despite the good  outcomes described, phalloplasty is associated with a high complication rate.  Most complications are related to the urethral reconstruction [<a href="#bib16">16</a>,<a href="#bib27">27&ndash;28</a>]. The main complications are fistulae and stenoses  whenever the urinary tract is attached to the native urethra. Despite the high  prevalence of these complications, the literature on treatment of these  complications is sparse. Consequently, always consider whether the urethral  reconstruction is necessary, as some boys will not need urethral reconstruction  as the bladder is augmented and diverted. In addition, it is important to  consider the ejaculation of the patient.<br>
    Is he actually ejaculating? Where? If so, do we  want to reconstruct the urethra for ejaculation alone, or do we want to keep  the ejaculation where it is? Preference should be given to keep the ejaculation  where it is as reconstructing a urethra just for ejaculation can result in  higher complications and possible anejaculation due to the length of the  urethra and the weakness of the ejaculation due to the underlying condition.<br>
    Urethral fistulas<br>
    Remove all scar tissue  and try to bring well-vascularized tissue to the area that needs  reconstruction. In radial forearm flap phalloplasty, we have to consider that  the tissue of the urethra is skin and not mucosa. Larger stitches with cutting  needles should be used. The duration of bladder drainage is unknown, but in our  practice we prefer to drain for 12 days. When using local skin flaps, consider  possible future hair growth in the urethra. A good alternative is the use of  buccalmucosa[<a href="#bib29">29</a>].<br>
    Urethral stenosis<br>
    In our experience we  first attempt an endoscopic incision of the stenosis, if the stricture is  relatively short. We leave a catheter for 12 days, which is much longer than  after urethrotomy for urethral stenosis in normal urethras. We have to remember  that part of the urethra is composed of skin, and healing of skin lesions is  much slower than mucosal healing.<br>
    If endoscopic incision fails, we perform a  formal urethroplasty. End-to&#8208;end anastomosis  or Heineke&#8208;Mikulicz type  reconstructions with longitudinal incision over the stenotic area closed  transversally. For longer strictures or complex and repetitive stricture, 2&#8208;stage urethroplasty (Johansson) must be considered. The stenotic  area is longitudinally incised and the borders of the stricture are sutured to  the surrounding healthy skin. The urethra remains opened until the skin and  urethra are well healed, which usually takes a minimum of three months. During  the second stage of the urethroplasty, the urethra is closed again and covered  with skin.</p>
  <div><br>
    <strong>Experience with phalloplasty in biological males </strong></div>
  <p>There are only a few  series published on this topic. Perovic reported phalloplasty in 24 patients  without a functional penis using the extended pedicle island groin flap. He  suggests this technique as an available alternative to the microsurgical free  tissue phalloplasty [<a href="#bib30">30</a>].<br>
    Sengezeret  al. suggested total penile reconstruction with sensate osteocutaneous  free fibula flap. With this technique, promising results were obtained in 18  patients without a functional penis for different reasons [<a href="#bib31">31</a>].  Gilbert et al. were the first  to describe the application of a radial free forearm flap for phallic  reconstruction in 11 boys without a functional penis. Satisfactory results were  obtained [<a href="#bib32">32</a>].<br>
    We performed phalloplasty in 19 males with the  use of the radial forearm flap: eight boys with inadequate penis after  exstrophy repair; one boy with penile loss after multiple hypospadias repair;  six boys with DSD andmicropenis; one boy with a penile epithelioid sarcoma; one  boy with ideopathicmicropenis; and two men who traumatically lost their penis.  There were no complications concerning the flap. Two complications were  reported in the early postoperative period: one pulmonary embolism and one  severe hematuria. Four patients developed urinary complications (stricture  and/or fistula) for which a secondary procedure was necessary.<br>
    In a further five boys &ndash;two with cripple  exstrophy and three after cloacalexstrophy &ndash; phalloplasty was done with an ALT  flap..<br>
    Patient satisfaction after surgery was high in  22 cases and moderate in two cases. Psychological evaluation confirms this,  especially on the self-esteem level. Ten patients underwent erectile implant  surgery. In two patients, the erectile implant had to be removed because of  infection (unpublished data).<br>
    In our series, one adolescent patient presented  with epithelioid sarcoma of the penis and the phalloplasty was performed in a  1-stage procedure with the penectomy [<a href="#bib33">33</a>]. This could be  an option for some patients undergoing penile amputation if oncologically  acceptable.<br>
    The reported success of phalloplasty in boys  without a functional penis has convinced us that penile reconstruction is the  optimal treatment for this condition. It has extremely good results and  improves their self-esteem and their physical and psychological wellbeing. But  the complication rate of the erectile implants is high.<br>
    Phalloplasty opens new horizons for the  treatment of penile agenesis, micropenis, crippled penis, shrivelled penis,  some disorders of sexual development (DSD) conditions, traumatic amputations in  which the amputated segment is lost for replantation, iatrogenic amputations,  and cloacalexstrophy.</p>
