  <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong><br>
    Abnormalities of the  ureterovesical junction (UVJ) were first classified into obstructed, refluxing,  or unobstructed and not refluxing by Smith <em>et  al.</em> 1, who  also subdivided them into primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired). King 2  later published a more practical classification: obstructed, refluxing,  non-obstructed and non-refluxing, or both obstructed and refluxing. Congenital  UVJ anomalies often present due to the detection of an associated dilated or  &lsquo;mega&rsquo;-ureter (Fig.1). Congenital megaureters are twice as common in males, and  present with a left-to-right ratio of 1.8:1 3. As  the refluxing UVJ anomaly is discussed in detail elsewhere, the focus of this  chapter will be the obstructed, and non-obstructed non-refluxing, megaureters. <br>

  <p><strong><u>Embryology and genetics of the ureterovesical  junction</u></strong><br>
    UVJ anomalies form  part of the congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) family.  Briefly, CAKUT includes a spectrum of anomalies affecting the formation of the  urinary tract, including renal agenesis, dysplasia or hypoplasia; proximal or  distal ureteric obstruction (ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) or UVJ obstruction);  dilatation of the ureter (megaureter); ureteric incompetence (vesicoureteric  reflux) and urethral obstruction (e.g. due to posterior urethral valves or  urethral atresia)4. Embryologically,  the mammalian kidney derives from two components: the ureteric bud, an epithelium  that branches recurrently to form the collecting ducts, and the metanephric mesenchyme.  The ureteric bud also gives rise to the epithelium of the renal pelvis and  ureter, which is known as the urothelium5. <br>
    To date, our  knowledge of normal ureteral development is limited to what we have learnt from  animal models such as transgenic mice with abnormal renal/ ureteral phenotypes.  These studies suggest that several genes, transcription factors, as well as secreted  proteins, contribute to normal ureteral development, that when deranged,  manifest various forms of CAKUT. A key player in ureteric development is the glial  cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and the transmembrane c-ret protein  tyrosine kinase (GDNF/c-ret) axis4.  Ureteric bud sprouting and branching is dependent on the interaction between GDNF  and its co-receptor glycosyl-phosphaditylinositol-anchored co-receptor 1  (Gfr&alpha;1), which bind to and activate c-ret. GDNF is primarily expressed in the  metanephric mesenchyme, the trigonal wedge of the distal ureter and the  urogenital sinus. In c-ret -/-mutants, renal agenesis, severe hypodysplasia and  blind-ending ureters were observed; GDNF -/- and Gfr&alpha;1 -/- mutants were also found  to have similar phenotypes 6, suggesting  that the GDNF-c-ret axis is required for ureteric bud initiation and early  branching morphogenesis.<br>
    C-ret expression is  retinoic acid (a metabolite of Vitamin A) dependent. Batourina <em>et al.</em> 7  showed that Vitamin A and the Ret proto-oncogene are required for formation of a  proper connection between the bladder and ureter. Mouse mutants lacking <em>Ret</em> or <em>Rara</em> and <em>Rarb</em>, two  retinoid receptor family members, had hydronephrosis and megaureter, both of  which were linked to defects at early stages of ureter maturation, when &ldquo;common  nephritic duct&rdquo; (CND - the name given by Batourina <em>et al.</em> to the part of the mesonephric duct proximal to the origin  of the ureteric bud) remodeling induces ureteric orifices to separate from the  mesonephric ducts. Their studies suggested that Vitamin A and <em>Ret </em>were required for the expansion of  the CND into a structure called the wedge, which they proposed was the likely  precursor of the trigone. However, their ensuing experiments challenged the traditional  explanation for the mode of insertion of the ureter into the bladder 8. The  traditional model of ureter maturation suggests that the ureteric orifice is  transposed from its initial location at the end of the CND to the urogenital  sinus, which differentiates into the bladder and urethra. The common nephritic  duct integrates into the urogenital sinus, forming the trigone, and repositioning  the ureters and the mesonephric duct in the process 9,  10. However, Batourina <em>et al.</em> showed that the CND does not  differentiate into the trigone, but instead undergoes apoptosis. Rather than  differentiating into the trigone, the wedge may be a transient structure that  is formed as the CND undergoes remodeling and subsequently regresses. Vitamin A  signaling is required for both urogenital sinus differentiation and for  generating signals that control CND apoptosis 8. On  the other hand, the trigone is formed mostly from bladder smooth muscle, with a  more minor contribution from the ureter 11.  Although an explanation for the abnormal development for the ureterovesical  junction has not been put forward, it seems likely that an aberrant development  of this pathway may be implicated.<br>
    The timing of smooth  muscle differentiation in the distal ureter is unknown, but may be key to  understanding why reflux or obstruction develop in-utero, persist in the  newborn, and subside later in childhood. Pirker <em>et al.</em> 12 studied  bladder specimens form porcine fetuses, newborn and 6-month old piglets. They  found that at 60 days, bladder detrusor muscle was well-developed and  innervated, whereas the intra- and extra-vesical ureter had only just started  to differentiate. At day 90, the extravesical ureter was well-innervated, but  the intra-vesical ureter did not mature until after birth. All smooth muscle  components showed a striking increase in bulk between neonatal and later  sections. The time-course of muscular development in this study correlates with  findings in humans, in whom smooth muscle bundles of the extramural ureter  first appear in weeks 17 to 22 of gestation, and ureteral muscle development  proceeds in a craniocaudal direction 13. The  authors also noticed that periureteral sheath development precedes ureteral  smooth muscle development, which was also reported in humans. The periureteral  sheath showed considerable postnatal neuromuscular development. Its muscle  fibres grew significantly, and almost formed a continuous layer at 6 months 12. Tanagho 14 also observed that the distal ureter is the last  portion to develop its muscular coat, and that early muscular differentiation  is primarily of the circular muscles. The process whereby the circular muscle  pattern, which is typical of the fetal ureter, changes progressively into the  double muscle layers of the full-term infant, mOther studies have suggested possible explanations for the development of  UVJ obstruction. These include a thick sleeve of muscle around the distal  portion of the ureter 15, increased deposition of collagen fibres 16 and dysregulated neuromodulation in the  juxtavesical segment of obstructed megaureters 17. Payabvash <em>et  al. </em>18 studied a series of obstructed ureters from  patients between 6 months and 2 years of age, and showed the presence of  increased myocyte apoptosis, reduced vascular and neural elements, associated  with increased collagen fibres. Interestingly, Kang <em>et al.</em> 19 showed that there are significant differences in  the number of smooth muscle cells, myocyte apoptosis indices, and number of  C-kit positive Cajal-like cells, between the obstructive and refluxing  subgroups. ay last up to two years, and may  explain the transient functional disturbances of the UVJ during this period.<br>

  <p><strong><u>Prenatal diagnosis</u></strong><br>
    In most U.K. centers,  prenatal scans are performed routinely at 12 weeks (the &ldquo;dating&rdquo; scan) and 18  to 20 weeks (the &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; scan) gestation. Further scans are performed later  in pregnancy when indicated, such as in cases of upper tract dilatation,  bilateral hydronephrosis, a thick-walled bladder, or the presence of  oligohydramnios.&nbsp; Data form a large  European database for surveillance of congenital malformations (EUROCAT)  collected over a ten-year period gave an overall prevalence of congenital  hydronephrosis of 11.5 per 10,000 births. 73% of cases were  prenatally-diagonsed, and 72% were male 20. The  proportion of these cases which also had a dilated ureter is not known. The  detection of a dilated ureter in-utero by ultrasound is a difficult endeavor.  The fetus may not be in the proper orientation, or the ureter may be obscured  by overlying structures or maternal bowel gas. Furthermore, technicians may not  be trained to specifically look for dilated ureters on routine screening. As a  result, the prenatal detection of dilated ureters is likely to be unreliable 3. In  a study of 101 patients with postnatally-identified hydroureteronephrosis referred  to Great Ormond Street Hospital, only 20% had a dilated ureter documented  prenatally 3.  Forty-eight (47.5%) infants were found to have VUR or other pathology, and 53 (52.5%)  were suspected of having a UVJ obstruction. </p>
  <p><strong><u>Postnatal investigation</u></strong><br>
Postnatally, babies  with prenatally-diagnosed hydronephrosis are started on antibiotic prophylaxis,  until a definitive diagnosis is made. Initial investigation involves a renal  tract ultrasound scan, which is ideally carried out between days 3 and 7 of  life. Boys with bilateral hydronephrosis should be catheterized and an urgent ultrasound  and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) obtained, in order to exclude bladder  outlet obstruction (BOO) such as posterior urethral valves, and/or identify  bilateral VUR. In the absence of urethral obstruction, 99mTc-MAG-3 diuretic  renography and a repeat ultrasound scan should be performed after 4 weeks of  age. &nbsp;In the presence of unilateral  dilatation (Fig.2a and b), an ultrasound scan, MAG-3 diuretic renography and a  VCUG are performed between four weeks and three months of age. <br>
Babies presenting  postnatally (e.g. with a urinary tract infection) are also investigated in a  similar fashion, although it is wise to wait for recovery from urosepsis before  embarking on an MCUG or MAG-3. <br>
According to the  European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) guidelines for standard and  diuretic renography in children, renography allows estimation of two aspects of  renal function 21.  The first aspect is renal clearance, or differential renal function (DRF). DRF  estimation is best undertaken between one and two minutes after tracer  injection. The second aspect is the excretion, or disappearance, of the tracer  from the kidney.&nbsp; Traditionally, an  important delay in excretion is suggested by a continuously ascending curve and  delayed transit, i.e. a Tmax (i.e. time to reach the maximum, or peak, of the  curve) over 20 minutes (Fig.3a and b). However, delayed transit may be caused  by the increased capacity afforded by a dilated pelvis and ureter <em>per se</em>. Hence, furosemide is  administered in order to increase urine flow in an attempt to distinguish  between good, intermediary and poor drainage 22. Poor  drainage may also be apparent because the bladder is full, or because the  effect of gravity on drainage is incomplete. For all these reasons, the interpretation  of &ldquo;impaired drainage&rdquo; on diuretic renography is controversial. Long-term  follow-up has shown that on sequential diuretic renograms, there may be both  stable DRF and renal pelvis size, but the drainage is often impaired to varying  degrees 22.  This clinical observation suggests that only when there is a decrease in renal  function and/or progressive dilatation of the renal pelvis can it be assumed  that progressive renal deterioration has started 22.  However, the pediatric urologist wishes to intervene before the onset of this  deterioration, and there is on-going debate whether this impaired drainage is  that indication.<br>
Therefore, a  combination of clinical and radiological findings must be taken into account  when labeling a megaureter as &ldquo;obstructed&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-obstructed&rdquo;. The presence of  symptoms, such as febrile urinary tract infection, or pain, are clinical  indicators of a problem within the system. In the asymptomatic patient, the  presence of a DRF below 40%, and/or increasing dilatation on serial ultrasound  scans, are also suggestive of obstruction and indications for intervention.  Delayed transit on MAG-3 in the presence of stable or improving dilatation, and  a DRF above 40%, in an asymptomatic patient, is not a strong indicator of  obstruction, although continued follow-up would be indicated. Liu <em>et al.</em> 3 and  McLellan <em>et al.</em> 23 suggested  that children with a retrovesical ureteral diameter greater than 10 mm were  more likely to require surgical intervention. <br>
It is important to be  aware that ipsilateral UPJ and UVJ obstruction may co-exist. The pre-operative  MAG-3 may suggest dual pathology when the obstructed ureter fills but fails to  drain, as the obstructed pelvis slowly drains. Cay <em>et al.</em> 24 reported  that a retrograde pyelogram was helpful in making a diagnosis in those cases  which were suspected pre-operatively. Most of the patients in their case  series, however, were only suspected of having both a UVJO and UPJO when a  dilated ureter was discovered at pyeloplasty, and after difficulty inserting a  stent past the UVJ. A post-operative nephrostogram confirmed the diagnosis.<br>

  <p><strong><u>Management</u></strong><br>
The trend in the management of primary megaureters has changed over the  past twenty years. In 1989, Peters <em>et al.</em> reported that 89% of patients required surgery before 8 months of age 25. That same year, Keating <em>et al</em>. 26 reported that when the decision to intervene was  based on absolute renal function, up to 87% of patients could be followed up  conservatively. A further publication from the same unit confirmed stability or  improvement at long-term follow-up of the same group of patients who managed  conservatively 27. Liu <em>et al.</em> 3 also suggested that the majority of megaureters may  be followed up conservatively, and showed that at a mean follow-up of 3.1  years, 34% of primary megaureters resolved spontaneously. Of the remaining  cases, 17% were reimplanted due to break-through infection or deteriorating  renal function, whereas 49% had persistent dilatation at follow-up, and were  still being monitored conservatively.</p>
  <p><strong>Non-obstructed non-refluxing megaureters</strong><br>
    Megaureters  associated with a DRF &gt;40% in an asymptomatic patient, may be managed conservatively.  Close follow-up (every 3-4 months with ultrasound) and antibiotic prophylaxis  are warranted for at least the first year of life, especially in cases with  significant dilatation (&gt;1cm ureteral diameter) 3,  23. Song <em>et al.</em> 28  showed that the risk of UTI is higher with UVJ than UPJ obstruction, and that  UTI&rsquo;s tend to occur within the first six months of life. Once the  hydronephrosis is noted to be improving, follow-up appointments may be reduced  to six-monthly and then annually, and antibiotic prophylaxis discontinued. At a  median follow-up of 25.8 months, McLellan <em>et  al.</em> showed that hydronephrosis had resolved completely in 72% of cases [27].  Children with persistent megaureter at the end of the study were noted to have  a significant decrease in the degree of hydronephrosis, suggesting a dynamic  process with a trend towards resolution. The authors also suggested that  presenting Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) grade of hydronephrosis had a  significant effect on median age of resolution (Table 1 summarizes SFU grades  of hydronephrosis). Megaureters with grades 1 - 3 hydronephrosis at diagnosis  were likely to resolve between 12 and 36 months of age. Grades 4 - 5  hydronephrosis took a longer period to resolve, up to 72 months 23.</p>
  <p>There is no evidence,  however, that resolution is permanent, and recent studies suggest that  follow-up should continue into adult life. A long-term follow-up study by Shukla <em>et  al.</em> 29 reported late deterioration in a 14-year old boy  with bilateral primary megaureters, who presented with increased dilatation and  functional deterioration six years after he was discharged from conservative  follow-up. Even more alarming is the study by Hemal <em>et al.</em> 30, which reported the outcome of 55 patients with  congenital megaureters presenting for the first time in the third decade of  life, of whom 20 patients were found to have renal calculi. Five patients with  bilateral megaureters were in chronic renal failure at diagnosis, of whom two  eventually died of the disease.&nbsp; Hence early  resolution following conservative management is not a life-long guarantee, and  follow-up into adulthood is advisable.</p>
  <p><strong>Obstructed megaureters (UVJ obstruction)</strong><br>
    The obstructed  megaureter requires surgical intervention in order to preserve renal function. &nbsp;Although in most cases, the definitive  intervention is ureteric reimplantation, other interventions have been proposed  as temporizing measures. These include:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Temporary JJ-stenting</li>
    <li>Endoscopic balloon       dilatation</li>
    <li>Endoureterotomy</li>
    <li>Refluxing       ureterocystotomy</li>
    <li>Cutaneous ureterostomy</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Ureteric  Reimplantation</em><br>
Peters <em>et al.</em><em>31</em> showed that repair of an obstructed megaureter in  early infancy improves renal drainage as assessed by excretory urography, and  therefore offers the potential for preventing renal damage before the  development of symptoms or decline in function on the renogram. Ureteric  reimplantation allows the aperistaltic, narrow segment to be excised, and the  ureter to be tunneled into the bladder in an anti-reflux fashion. The tunnel  should be at least five times the ureteral diameter to be effective, data based  on a study by Paquin in 1959 32. In order to obtain this ratio when the ureteral  diameter is above 10 mm, the distal 10 cm of the ureter may need to be tapered.  A psoas hitch may also be required in order to ensure a straight entry of the  ureter into the bladder. The two popular techniques used for tailoring  megaureters are plication as reported by Starr33 and Kalicinski <em>et  al.</em><em>34</em>, and tapering as modified by Hendren35. Kalicinski <em>et  al.</em> described a folding technique whereby the lateral, avascular part of  the ureter was excluded from the lumen by a longitudinal running suture, and  then folded posteriorly prior to re-implantation34. Starr modified this procedure, introducing many  interrupted Lembert sutures that folded the ureteral wall inwards, thus  preserving its blood supply, but making the subsequent re-implantation more  cumbersome 33. Hendren advised excisional tapering, whereby a  longitudinal strip of the redundant ureter is excised, and the ureter sutured  in two layers 35. Ben-Meir <em>et  al.</em> 36 compared the outcome of megaureter reimplantation  with and without tailoring, and showed that there was no significant difference  in outcome (94% success rate in the tailored group, and 96% in the non-tailored  group). Intravesical reimplantation (Cohen and Leadbetter-Politano) techniques  are preferable when the ureter has been tailored, especially in older children  with a degree of bladder dysfunction 37. Laparoscopic and robotic ureteric tapering and  implantation techniques have also been described 38, 39, although long-term results are awaited. <br>
Ureteric reimplantation in infants below one year of age may be challenging  due to the discrepancy between the grossly-dilated ureter and the small  infantile bladder, and concern regarding possible iatrogenic bladder  dysfunction. De Jong 40 investigated the bladder functional outcome of 49  neonates and infants with primary obstructive or refluxing megaureters, who  underwent a Politano Leadbetter procedure, at a mean follow-up of 7.3 years.&nbsp; No onset of voiding dysfunction was noted at  follow-up, and bladder capacity for age was significantly increased. No  post-operative ureteral obstruction was observed. The author concluded that  early major reconstructions of the lower urinary tract do not damage the  urodynamic properties of the bladder and pelvic floor, provided that the surgery  is performed by specialized pediatric urological surgeons. A further study from  the same group 41  compared urodynamic outcome in patients who underwent ureteral reimplantation  before, or after, one year of age. No significant difference in bladder capacity,  compliance, or incidence of instability, was found. </p>
  <p><em>Endoscopic  procedures</em><br>
In 1999, Shenoy and Rance reported of the use of JJ stents as a  temporizing measure in infants with primary obstructive megaureters 42. The procedure involves the  insertion of a 4.7 F or 5.2 F double  pigtail stent, endoscopically where possible. A tight UVJ obstruction  may preclude endoscopic insertion, in which case an open insertion via a  cystostomy combined with dilatation of the ureteric orifice using a lachrymal  probe may be performed. Stents are licensed to remain in-situ for six months,  following which, they should be removed or replaced. The megaureter should be  stented until the baby is over one year of age, by which time a ureteric  reimplantation may be safely performed 43.  The baby should remain on prophylactic antibiotics while the stent is in-situ, due  to the risk of stent infection, and should be monitored by ultrasonography to  ensure decompression of the system, and to check stent position. An ultrasound  scan and MAG-3 renography performed three months after removal of stent will  direct further management. In the presence of improved dilatation and drainage,  and preserved function, no further intervention may be required 43.  Persistent or worsening dilatation after a period of stenting, or further  infection, is an indication for ureteric reimplantation. A long-term outcome  study43  revealed that in 56% of cases, no further intervention was required after  removal of the stent. However, two-thirds  of patients required open stent insertion, and one-third suffered complications  (migration, stone formation and infection). <br>
Angerri <em>et al.</em> 44 published their experience with endoscopic balloon  dilatation using a 4 F dilating balloon insufflated to 12-14 atm for 3-5  minutes. Disappearance of the narrowed ring was verified radiologically. A  JJ-stent was left in-situ for two months. Of seven patients, post-operative  drainage improved in five patients after one dilatation, and in a further  patient after two dilatations. However, follow-up was short, and the long-term  outcome not known. <br>
Kajbafzadeh <em>et al.</em> 45 described an endoureterotomy procedure in patients  with &ldquo;intravesical ureteral obstruction&rdquo; and a stricture length &lt;1.5cm.  Their case series of 47 patients includes infants as young as 1.5 months,  although mean age at intervention was 3.7 years. The authors report an  impressive success rate of 90% at a mean follow-up of 39 months, including 71%  complete resolution of hydronephrosis, with self-limiting haematuria as the  only complication. </p>
  <p><em>Temporizing procedures</em><br>
    Temporizng measures include the refluxing ureteral reimplant, described  by Lee <em>et al</em>.46, whereby the ureter proximal to the obstruction is  anastomosed to the dome of the bladder in a freely refluxing fashion, thus  converting &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; obstruction to the lesser evil that is reflux. A  temporary cutaneous ureterostomy is an alternative option, though not without  its complications, which include stomal stenosis and pyelonephritis 47. <br>

  <p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong><br>
    UVJ anomalies may be  obstructive, refluxing, non-obstructed and non-refluxing, or both refluxing and  obstructed. All types of congenital UVJ anomalies may be associated with a  dilated or &lsquo;mega&rsquo;-ureter, therefore careful patient assessment, combined with  radiological investigation, is required to identify &ldquo;obstructed&rdquo; megaureters  which require surgical intervention. Only 10-20% of megaureters require  intervention, whilst the remainder may be monitored conservatively. Surgical  options include ureteric reimplantation, with or without ureteral tailoring,  endoscopic procedures, or temporizing measures such as a cutaneous ureterostomy  or refluxing ureterneocystostomy.<strong></strong></p>
