<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
  <p>The term hypospadias is derived from the Greek words  hypo (below, too little) and Spadone (crack, gutter). Hypospadias is the most  common congenital defect of the penis. It is characterized by the abnormal  position of urethral meatus on the ventral penile shaft. Structures affected in varying  degrees are the anterior urethral portion, the glans, the prepuce, the corpus  spongiosum and corpora cavernosa. </p>
  <p>Depending on the severity of the defect, effects range from purely  aesthetic to severe functional disorders, with accompanying mental health  problems. Patients with severe untreated hypospadias can&acute;t achieve normality  regarding micturition and sexual life. </p>
  <p>About 400 surgical techniques have  been published, <a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1">but </a>the  search for the &ldquo;perfect hypospadias correction&rdquo; continues. &nbsp;  Since nowadays the aesthetic result  has nearly the same relevance as the functional outcome, the strategies and  objectives have refined the hypospadias correction technique further and the concept of  hypospadiologists was coined by Duckett in1995. Because it is a complex plastic and reconstructive procedure  with a significant learning curve, this type of operation should be performed only at centers with extensive experience. <br>
Since the surgical  treatment is usually done early in childhood and purely cosmetic procedures  have a significant complication rate, parents should be given full information  with respect to the rationale for surgery ( cosmetic v/s functional or both) to facilitate their decision for or  against a surgical correction. </p>
  <p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
  <p>Hypospadias is defined as the combination of three  anatomical abnormalities of the penis: </p>
  <p><img width="126" height="107" src="images/hypospadias/hypospadias_clip_image003_0006.gif" align="left" hspace="12">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ectopic meatus and dorsal winged  prepuce</p>
  <p><img width="100" height="107" src="images/hypospadias/hypospadias_clip_image006.gif" align="left" hspace="12"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br>
  Ventral penile shaft desviation</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Proximal urethra, with or       without ectopic stenotic meatus, which may be       located on the ventral side at any position between       the tip of the glans and the perineum. </li>
    <li>A ventral penile shaft deviation. </li>
    <li>&nbsp;A typical dorsal winged prepuce, by a lack of       circular ventral union of the prepuce.<br>  
      <br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The 2nd and 3rd characteristics may not  necessarily be present. In contrast, the first feature is an unconditional part  of the definition.</p>
  <p>Special cases are the &ldquo;Sine&rdquo; hypospadias and the &quot;Megalomeatus&quot; </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div>
      <img src="images/hypospadias/hypospadias_clip_image003.gif" width="128" height="135">
    </ol>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    &nbsp;The sine  hypospadias is characterized by a ventral curvature of the penile shaft and an orthotopic position of the  meatus.
  <ol>
  <ul>
    <li>The Megalomeatus is characterized by a coronal lying meatus adjacent to a non closed-glans with  an open navicular fossa and a circular prepuce.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><br>
  </p>
  <p><strong><br>
  Classification </strong></p>
<p>The most common classification was published by Duckett in 1996. He  divided them into anterior (50%), middle (30%) and posterior (20%) hypospadias. <br>
    These are also classified according to the location of  the meatus. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The anterior form: glandular, coronal and distal  penile.</li>
    <li>The middle form: &quot;midshaft&rdquo; and proximal penile.</li>
    <li>The posterior form: penoskrotal, scrotal and perineal.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Other classifications are listed in the following  figure.</p>
  <img src="images/hypospadias/hypo01.jpg" width="838" height="716">
  <p><strong>Frequency</strong><br>
The incidence of  hypospadias has been reported to be anywhere between 0.4 to 8.2 cases per 1000 newborn  boys. The large differences in frequency have their origin in geographical,  genetic and environmental influences, as well as the variety of data  collection. According to the &quot;Centers for Disease Control&quot; the  highest probability of hypospadias is in the Caucasian population followed by  African-Americans and then the Hispanic Americans. <br>
The incidence of  hypospadias is increasing in both Europe and North America but the reasons are not yet clearly understood. &nbsp;According to information from the &quot;Birth  Defects Monitoring Program&rdquo;, reports show an increase in the incidence of 20.2  per 10,000 in 1970 to 39.7 per 10,000 children born in the U.S.A. This increase  was independent of&nbsp; improvements in  medical care and improved diagnostics. Similarly,  according to Borer and Retik (1999), there has been an increase in the number  of more severe hypospadias &nbsp;five fold  compared with the more distal forms. This can be explained by the increase in the number of  premature births, and the contact of the fetus with progesterone or other  substances with estrogenic or anti-androgenic effect. On the other hand, there  has not been an increase in the incidence in developing countries. </p>
  <p><strong>Etiology </strong><br>
The etiology of hypospadias is  multifactorial. In 66-75% of hypospadias the  cause remains unknown (Spindler et al. 2001). Somatic sexual development  is associated with essential androgens. Therefore,  it seems likely that defects in the androgen synthesis or its action during  embryogenesis lead to hypospadias. <br>
According to Spindler et al. (2001),  hypospadias is also found in the most common disorder of sex development, the familial  male pseudohermaphroditism. Zhu et al. (1998), and Geraudie and Ferreti (1998) demonstrated  androgen metabolism failure, androgen receptor defects or genetic disorders in  less than 5% of patients. Another cause is the ingestion of substances with  estrogenic activity, such as insecticides, natural estrogens, organic products  from the manufacture of plastics and pesticides, which are included in food.  These are suspected to be the cause of increased  incidence of hypospadias in  developed countries. Semenza et al. showed in 1997, after animal models, that estrogens can  lead to developmental delay and stop development of the penis. <br>
A genetic predisposition is  discussed as a cause of hypospadias. The probability to have a second child  with hypospadias is 14%. If the father has hypospadias, the probability that  one of his sons suffers from the same pathology is 8%. Similarly, hypospadias is  present in many syndromes, such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome or Robinow  syndrome. However, in these cases the exact cause is unknown <u></u></p>
  <p><strong>Risk Factors</strong><br>
There is an increased probability for the occurrence of hypospadias,  under certain conditions</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Father with hypospadias</li>
    <li>Low birth weight</li>
    <li>Twin or triplet births</li>
    <li>Maternal iron supplements</li>
    <li>Smoking mothers</li>
    <li>Fathers with pesticide contact</li>
    <li>Pregnancy through artificial insemination or medical support</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Embryology </strong></p>
  <p>The chromosomal sex is determined at fertilization by haploid sperm. If  a Y chromosome is present, the indifferent gonad in stage 18 is differentiated  into a testis and determines the gonadal sex. The formation of the somatic sex  is determined by the existing gonad. Androgens are formed in the fetal testis.  The Sertoli cells produce the Anti M&uuml;llerian Hormone (AMH) and the Leydig cells  the testosterone. The distribution of these two hormones is responsible for the  development of the male genitalia (Drews 2006). These hormones induce the  extension of the genital tubercle into the penis. Growth in length is formed on both  sides of the so-called  urethral genital tubercle. Thus, the urethral folds  form the lateral walls of the deep urethral groove. With the disappearance of the  urogenital membrane a column is formed, which grows until the bottom of the  genital tubercle, but falls short of the distal glans. Endodermal cells from the epithelial  lining of the column form the urethral plate. Towards the end of the third month the urethral folds  join above the urethral plate to form the penile urethra. The fusion area of the urethral  folds migrates from the base to the tip of the penis. However, the tip of the  penis is not reached.</p>
  <p>By the end of the fourth month the distal portion of  the urethra is formed, through the migration of the endoderm cells from the tip  of the penis inward, forming a short epithelial cord, which grows on the  existing urethra. This epithelial cord is channeled to form the definitive urethral meatus  at the tip of the glans. The exception to this is the concept of endodermal differentiation,  according to which the urothelium along the urethra comes from the urogenital  sinus. </p>
  <p>Therefore, the urethra is formed by the continuous growth of the  urethral plate in the genital tubercle, followed by the ventral fusion of the  urethra.</p>
  <p>The edges of the urethral plate grow forward over the coronary sulcus  and give rise to the foreskin, and a circular epithelial plate sinks between  the folds and the glans. </p>

  </ol>
  <p><strong>Pathogenesis </strong><br>
    Hypospadias is caused by the arrest  of normal development of the urethra, at various stages of embryonic development  (9 to 13 weeks of pregnancy). From the final shape of the anomaly,  the time when the  disturbance occurred can be predicted. In addition to the disturbances in the development  of the urethra, the development of the raphe and the foreskin can also be compromised. This results in hypospadias with deviation  from the raphe, the formation of a redundant dorsal prepuce foreskin and other  ventral defects of the prepuce.<br>

  <p>The penile shaft deviation can have several causes: </p>
  <ol>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chordee:</strong> fibrous remnant of  the corpus spongiosum distal to the meatus. It extends in a V shape on both sides, and  acts by the lack of elasticity producing a ventral deformity. </li>
    <li><strong>Dystrophic ventral penile shaft skin:</strong> frequently the  ventral penile skin is dystrophic and inelastic. These skin components are connected by fibrous bridges to the deep penile fascia (Buck&acute;s fascia) and the corpus spongiosum. </li>
    <li><strong>Scrotal transposition:</strong> This term refers to the highly  faceted scrotum (bifid scrotum), which shortens ventrally, due to a defect in the  caudal migration of the scrotum during fetal life. It usually does not generate a real penile shaft  deviation, only a visual effect, demonstrating a straight penile shaft during  palpation, even with an erection. When it comes to a more pronounced defect, it can act  as a barrier to erection. </li>
    <li>Faster growth of the posterior portions of the corpus cavernosum in  comparison to the ventral parts<strong>:</strong> probably this type of penile  curvation is the one presented in the special form of hypospadias, the sine  hypospadias. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Diagnosis: </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Should include:</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Classification</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarification of associated  anomalies: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>A patent processus vaginalis (9%)</li>
        <li>Undescended testes (5% in mild  forms, 31% for proximal hypospadias)</li>
        <li>Anomalies of the upper urinary  tract. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Penoscrotal  hypospadias in combination with undescended testes and scrotal transposition,  or DDS require a complete genetic  and hormonal evaluation. </li>
      <li>In severe hypospadias further  urological examinations should be included, such as a Voiding cystourethrogram  (MCU), to detect additional nephrourologic malformations. </li>
      <li>Physical  examination and abdominal ultrasound, because of a possible association with  kidney tumors in the more severe types of hypospadias. </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Treatment options:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Surgery is the treatment of choice for most hypospadias.</li>
    <li>The severity of the malformation determines  the  procedure. </li>
    <li>Functionality of the penis is the main objective. However, surgical correction may be  indicated only  for cosmetic purposes. Nevertheless, when  considering possible complications, the indication for surgery is more  restricted.</li>
    <li>In addition to general risks that can occur virtually  in all surgical procedures, including inflammation, wound healing disorders,  blood loss during and after surgery, urinary tract infection and disturbances  of sensation or scarring, there are also specific complications such as </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Urethral fistula  (5-15%) </li>
      <li>Scar narrowing of  the urethra (stricture) </li>
      <li>Recurrence of  penile curvature by growth in size of the penis with incomplete chordeectomy</li>
      <li>Urethral stenosis</li>
      <li>Urethral diverticula</li>
      <li>Scar deformation.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Treatment goals:</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Orthotopic location of the neomeatus in the distal glans</li>
    <li>Correction of chordee</li>
    <li>Normal urine flow (forward directed urinary stream) </li>
    <li>The highest possible aesthetic reconstruction with or without  prepucioplasty</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Timing of repair:</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>From the psychological point of view, there are two optimal times to  perform surgery:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The first between 6 and 15 months of  life</li>
      <ul>
        <li>One advantage of the first period is that the child still does not  identify his gender. The gender identification does not occur until about the  24 month of life. From that moment on a surgery on the genitals is experienced  as traumatic. </li>
        <li>Another advantage is that you can achieve the end of therapy before the  child enters school. </li>
        <li>Complications associated with the smaller size of the penis at this time  could be offset by drugs (Andractim) or improved operating conditions. </li>
        <li>Healing at this  age is much faster and more effective. &nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The second it between the third and  sixth year of life</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Considering psychosexual development hypospadias correction should be  completed within 30 months of life. The reasons for this are: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>At this time, the  child is not aware of his malformation and the sex differences </li>
      <li>In social relations at this age, genitals play no role. However, this changes when entering  school, where there is a high risk that the  child is socially excluded due to the different appearances of his penis or  because of different voiding characteristics sometimes associated with  hypospadias (urinating sitting down). </li>
      <li>From 30 months up to 5 &frac12; years, children develop a conscious  feeling of fear to physical pain, which can be influenced negatively by surgery. Children in this age group require  psychological support, to be sure that their sexual gender will not be altered  with surgery and that they are already boys (men). </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Surgical procedures</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Nowadays, correction is sought in a single stage operation</li>
    <li>Thus, a two-stage procedure is indicated only for severe hypospadias or for malformations with severe chordee or in which the urethra cannot be  repaired with only one surgery. &nbsp;</li>

  <p>Urinary diversion <br>
    <br>
For  most techniques a urinary diversion is performed to prevent urination trough  the newly created urethra, to support wound healing for some time. <br>
<img width="119" height="97" src="hypospadias_clip_image003.gif" align="left" hspace="12">Basically there are three different types of urinary  diversion available: </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Suprapubic urinary diversion with a puncture catheter (cistofixR)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Transurethral urinary diversion with: </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>A balloon catheter which drains into a urine bag. </li>
      <li>A &quot;dripping stent&rdquo;, which drains the bladder on a  diaper.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  <p><img src="images/hypospadias/hypo03.jpg" width="681" height="190"></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Without any urinary catheters </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The importance of urinary diversion  for preventing postoperative complications is not clear. One advantage of the  transurethral drainage, especially with &quot;dripping stent and double diaper,  is that it is much more comfortable, since the child can be mobilized quickly,  while a suprapubic drainage system forces him to rest in bed.</p>
  <p><strong>Complications</strong><br>
The complication rate of of  hypospadias correction is considerable, from 30 to 50%. <u> </u></p>
  <ol>
    <ol>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>Early complications: infection (1-2%), bleeding, bruising, wound  dehiscence, flap or graft necrosis, urinary tract infections, urinary tract  obstruction. </li>
          <li>Late complications:  urethral fistula (5 &ndash; 10%), meatal stenosis (7 &ndash; 15%), recurrent urethral  stricture or residual chordee (up to 20%), balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO)  ,&nbsp; urethral diverticula (4 &ndash; 7%).</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <p>The complications rate is  essentially dependent on the severity of hypospadias, the patient's age at the  time of surgical correction, the reconstruction technique used, the quality of  the surrounding tissue for the reconstruction, the  medical equipment and the surgeon's skills and experience and the number of previous  interventions. </p>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Childhood and Hypospadias </strong></p>
  <p>The psychological  development of the child with hypospadias is affected by those common variables  which affect all children, those pertaining to children with a physical  disorder and the requirement for medical and surgical intervention and those  very specific to children with a genital anomaly. General principles for good  psychological management of any child with a disorder involve minimum  disruption of family, school and social life, maximum opportunity for calm  informed empowerment through access to information, training and practical and  emotional support. </p>
  <p>Clinicians need to be alert  to risk factors and to co-morbidities in either child or parent, including  social disadvantage, parental psychopathology, parenting capabilities and  coping styles, and extreme adverse attitudinal and belief systems in a parent  or parents, in the nuclear family or in the cultural group. </p>
  <p>Chronic childhood illness  is a well-recognised stressor for children and their families. Findings for  specific disorders vary but the risk for adjustment disorder is estimated to be  1.5-3 times as high as for healthy peers. Chronic childhood conditions increase  the risk of parental adjustment disorder. The emotional impact and the  practical burden fall mainly on the mother. There is a significant increase in  levels of distress compared with mothers of well children. The risk of adjustment  difficulty is related to disorder severity but more strongly to illness length  and degree of functional impairment.</p>
  <p>It is important to be alert  to the specific risks and protective factors for male children. There is a  known greater incidence of psychological disorder in boys generally. </p>
  <p>The number of single  parents and changing male partnerships and the absence of the natural father in  households is a source of concern. Children are known to be adversely affected  by ambivalent relationships, by parental anxiety, by exposure to harsh and  inconsistent discipline, by separation during attachment, by disruption of peer  attachment and schooling, by exposure to fear and trauma and by poor  communication, particularly in relation to the expression of feeling states and  the development of reassuring and explanatory concepts.<br>
    There is evidence that the  children who are at greatest risk of developing a secondary psychological  disorder are those with pre-existing disadvantage and vulnerability and poorly  functioning families.<br><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

  <p>Editorial Comment<br>
    The incidence of hypospadias is  increasing in the western world. In my personal experience, the increase seems  to be predominantly of the more distal variety or the &lsquo;minor&rsquo; hypospadias. The  author has very clearly described the embryopathogenesis of hypospadias and the  principles of correction.<br>
    The important aspect of hypospadias  surgery is giving the parents full information about the condition before  obtaining consent. In the very distal hypospadias with a straight penis,  minimal glans tilt and a typical dorsal hood, the main if not the only reason  for surgery is aesthetic. This should be made very clear to the parents. I have  seen adult men with a minor hypospadias having no functional difficulties in  terms of micturition or sexual function. The inevitable question parents ask is  &lsquo; What will the penis look like when he is older?&rsquo; If only I had a crystal ball  to gaze into the future and identify those boys who would be psychologically  affected by their minor penile cosmetic blemish, decision making in terms of  who should undergo surgery would be so much easier.<br>
    The other point is who should  perform hypospadias surgery. I do not feel there should be an occasional  hypospadias surgeon as the best outcomes are achieved by those performing these  procedures on a regular basis. Outcomes are therefore very important and should  guide the surgeon in their own practice but should also guide the  patients/carers in choosing their surgeon. The technique of choice depends on  the surgeon as long as the principles of correction are followed and outcomes  achieved. It is safe to say that rather than experimenting with different  techniques, it is better to stick to a &lsquo;tried and tested&rsquo; technique which the  surgeon can reproduce over and over again with similar outcomes.<br>
