  <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spina bifida is a broad diagnostic  category that applies to a variety of neural tube defects (spinal dysraphisms)  that can have devastating effects on multiple organ systems.&nbsp; The distal spinal cord has a fundamental role  in bladder function, and the dysregulation secondary to spina bifida results in  the neuropathic bladder.&nbsp; Management of  the neuropathic bladder is complex with significant consequences with respect  to quality of life and renal health.&nbsp;  However, any practitioner would be remiss to consider treating the  bladder in isolation, as the abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS),  musculoskeletal system (MSK), and gastrointestinal systems mandate a  comprehensive approach to patient care.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early 1980s spina bifida was  reported to occur in approximately 1/1,000 births, but this incidence has been  shown to be significantly decreasing.1,2 This  has been attributed to improved pre-natal care (folate supplementation) and  elective termination of pregnancies3. One of the greatest advances in prenatal care over the past  several decades was the discovery of the link between folic acid and neural  tube defects.&nbsp;&nbsp; The current  recommendations for all women of child bearing age to consume 400 mg of folic acid daily has been responsible for a 50% reduction in incidence.4&nbsp; Most developed countries  mandate folate supplementation in grain products.5<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although no specific gene has been  identified, there are multiple suggestions implicating a genetic  component.&nbsp; There is an increased risk  with chromosomal abnormalities and an increased risk when a relative is  affected6.&nbsp; The risk in a mother with  one affected child is 20-50 per 1000 and increases to 1 in 10 if she has 2  affected children.&nbsp; The risk also  increases with maternal age so that a mother older than 35 years has a risk of  4%.&nbsp; There is evidence for both an  autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance pattern7, 8.&nbsp; However, the significant phenotypic  variability seen within these families suggests a pleiotropic effect, a variety  of potential genetic causes, or variability in key environmental exposure  during susceptible periods of pregnancy6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, family members  of patients are advised to take 4000 mg  starting at least two months before conception.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the etiology, the  pathophysiology of spinal dysraphisms involves the incomplete closure of the  spinal cord and vertebral column.&nbsp; This  process begins at approximately 18 days and is complete by 35 days  gestation.&nbsp; Closure begins cranially and  progresses caudally.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of neural tube defects  are myelomeningocele, which involves the evagination of neural tissue,  accounting for over 90% of open neural tube defects.&nbsp; A meningocele occurs when the meningeal sac  extends beyond the spinal canal, but does not contain any neural elements  within it.&nbsp; A lipomeningocele occurs when  the distal cord is compromised by fatty infiltrations.&nbsp; The majority of defects are directed  anteriorly, but rarely can protrude posteriorly.&nbsp; The most common site of the defect is in the  lumbosacral spine (47%), followed by lumbar (26%) and sacral (20%).&nbsp; Less common defects occur in the thoracic  spine (5%), cervical spine (2%), and anencephaly (1%)5.&nbsp; 85% of lesions are  associated with the Arnold-Chiari Chiari &ndash; type II malformation (also referred  to as Arnold-Chiari malformation), whereby the cerebellar vermis and brainstem  protrude through the foramen magnum, obstructing the outflow of CSF from the  fourth ventricle, and resulting in hydrocephalus5.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Contemporary  prenatal screening commonly result in a pre-natal diagnosis3.&nbsp; The spinal defect can be  seen on prenatal ultrasound.&nbsp; Maternal  serum screening with alpha-fetoprotein, alone or as part of a triple or  quadruple screen, also increases detection, but may have a false positive rate  up to 80%.&nbsp; Therefore, its benefit has  been questioned9.&nbsp; High-resolution ultrasound  has a reported diagnostic accuracy of up to 80%10.&nbsp; Fetal MRI results in  further anatomic detail and will likely supplant ultrasound as the diagnostic  modality of choice11.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prenatal diagnosis has resulted in  several fundamental changes in the management of patients of spina bifida.&nbsp; It has resulted in the mother&rsquo;s option  whether or not to continue with the pregnancy.&nbsp;  It has also resulted in the potential for pre-natal counseling, whereby  the parents can prepare for many aspects of their child&rsquo;s condition.&nbsp; At the author&rsquo;s institution, parents will  attend the spina bifida clinic before delivery, as this affords them the  opportunity to meet many of the staff and other families of our patients.&nbsp; This has proven to be an extremely valuable  resource.&nbsp; </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, prenatal diagnosis has  allowed for the development of fetal surgery, and the first pre-natal closure  of a myelomeningocele occurred in 199712.&nbsp; Original data from fetal  closure of the myelomeningocele demonstrated a decreased need for  vetriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunting secondary to hydrocephalus.&nbsp; This is currently being studied with a  randomized trial, which to date has accrued approximately 130 patients13.&nbsp; Although the primary end-points of the trial  are CNS related (the requirement for VP shunts and development) bladder  outcomes have been added as a secondary measure13.&nbsp; Initial data, outside the trial, describe an  increased incidence of denervated pattern to the external sphincter, compared  to patients with post-natal closure14. Complete results are anxiously awaited.</p>
  <p><strong>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The precise neuroanatomic defect in  spina bifida is extremely variable, and therefore, there is no single  phenotypic effect on the urinary tract.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The detrusor muscle, bladder neck, and external sphincter are all  independently susceptible to pathologic innervation with respect to both their  afferent and efferent nerves and cell bodies.&nbsp;  Furthermore, the complex interactions among the interneurons of the  spinal cord are inherently disrupted as well as their ascending and descending  pathways.&nbsp; Furthermore, it has been noted  that patients with proximal lesions (i.e. thoracic) can have intact, &ldquo;normal&rdquo;  distal spinal cords.&nbsp; Therefore, it  cannot be emphasized strongly enough that blanket predictions are not possible  and each patient must be thoroughly investigated and their care  individualized.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sympathetic innervation of the  bladder is via the L2, L3 and L4 nerve roots and induces detrusor contraction  via the muscarinic pathways.&nbsp; The  predominant receptor in the detrusor muscle is the M2 subtype.&nbsp; There is also sympathetic B2 activity, which  can aid the relaxation of the bladder.&nbsp;  Afferent innervation is also fundamental to its function, as the complex  reflex arcs in the bladder require the ability to detect stretch and  capacity.&nbsp; These interactions in the  spinal cord result in an absence of contractions, with active relaxation,  during filling and coordinated contraction upon the signal to void.&nbsp;&nbsp; During normal infancy this occurs without  any regulation, but during the toddler years central pathways develop to  modulate the filling and emptying cycle.&nbsp;  Most commonly, the abnormal innervation result the inability to suppress  detrusor contractility and an overactive bladder results.&nbsp; If the sensory afferents are also affected,  decreased sensation occurs, and the patient is unable to detect  &ldquo;fullness&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The less common scenario  involves a &ldquo;flaccid&rdquo; bladder that is unable to contract and empty.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both urinary sphincters are likewise  affected, with abnormal sacral innervation occurring via parasympathetic  outflow to the internal urinary sphincter (bladder neck) or via the pudendal  nerve affecting pelvic floor and rhabdosphincter innervation.&nbsp; Increased activity in either of these  pathways results in increased sphincter activity, and decreased efficacy of  emptying.&nbsp; Decreased activity results in  the inability to provide sufficient urethral resistance to store urine.&nbsp; However, the greatest threat to the patient  involves a dysregulation of the spinal reflex, when the urinary sphincters are  not able to relax upon the initiation of a bladder contraction.&nbsp;&nbsp; This results in the most significant voiding  abnormality, detrusor sphincter dyssenergia (DSD).&nbsp; The increased bladder contractility and  failure of sphincteric relaxation results in significantly elevated bladder  pressures and, over time, bladder decompensation.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the complex physiology of the  bladder is reduced to its most basic functions the diagnosis and treatment  options are simplified.&nbsp; By separating  the organ into its basic elements (detrusor or sphincter) and function  categorized as normal or overactive a helpful table can be constructed (Table 2).&nbsp; Individualized treat aimed at the fundamental  pathophysiology can be optimized to reduce renal risk and achieve continence.<br>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both upper and lower motor neuron  lesions are found with equal frequency15.&nbsp; Approximately 10% of  newborns have hydronephrosis thereby declaring an immediate renal risk  secondary to high detrusor pressures15.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial assessment is performed  as soon as possible after birth and closure of the neural defect, however this  often requires the child to spend several days in the prone position.&nbsp; Neonatal assessment consists of an ultrasound  of the bladder and kidneys as well as intermittent catheterization every 4  hours.&nbsp; Volumes are recorded to assess  for urinary residuals with greater than 15 cc considered abnormal.&nbsp; Frequency of catheterization can then be  tailored to the residuals, but some feel that aggressive CIC results in better  long-term outcomes16.&nbsp; Even if minimal residuals  are recorded, we find it beneficial at our institution to continue  catheterization to keep the parents and child accustomed to the routine and  maintain their skills.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these children require  thorough, regular evaluations in a multi-disciplinary clinic for the remainder  of their lives.&nbsp; Although many children&rsquo;s  hospitals have adopted a spin bifida clinic as routine care, most of our adult  patients have not yet been afforded the same level of care.&nbsp; Regular history and physical examination are  required to assess continence status, urinary tract infections (UTI),  difficulties catheterizing, and psychosocial measures.&nbsp; It is of a paramount importance for the clinician  to be aware of any changes in their voiding pattern, as this may be easily  remedied with basic conservative measures or portend significant pathology such  as a tethered spinal cord, or bladder stone.&nbsp;  The pediatric urologist is also paramount with the assessment and  treatment of bowel function and continence.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although continence is readily  appreciable by history, renal risk is often insidious.&nbsp; Therefore, regular assessment of the upper  tracts is required with ultrasound to detect any changes before irreversible  damage has occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; While simple and  effective in the newborn, patient habitus can preclude accurate examination  through adolescence.&nbsp; Nuclear  scintigraphy has a less prominent role, as most hydronephrosis will be due to  bladder pressure, but concomitant UPJ or UVJ obstruction will occur and a MAG-3  may provide additional information.&nbsp; DMSA  renal scans are helpful in identifying scars secondary to recurrent infections  as well as congenital renal dysplasia.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KUB radiographs are useful for detecting  bladder calculi and can be used to screen high-risk patients, such as those  with an intestinocystoplasty or patients who have had prior stones.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urodynamics play an integral role in  the management of neuropathic bladders, for both the prevention of both renal  damage and urinary incontinence.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Although it has been advocated to obtain initial urodynamics before the  neonatal closure, most centers do not find this practical.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most initial evaluations occur at 3-6 months  of age, after a period of time has elapsed for &ldquo;spinal shock&rdquo; to resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because these patterns are noted to progress  during early years, frequent urodynamics are recommended17.&nbsp; Beyond the neonatal years,  urodynamics should be performed annually or with any change in voiding pattern  as well as in the diagnostic evaluation for a possible tethered spinal cord.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clinician should be vigilant  regarding the potential for a secondary tethered cord, with the highest risk  periods seen during rapid growth, around the age of two and puberty.&nbsp; This risk is secondary to increased traction  on the distal placode which has been immobilized secondary to surgical  scarring, resulting in ischemia and loss of function. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New or progressive urinary  dysfunction, or an increase in symptomatic UTIs, may be the earliest sign of a  retethering of the neural placode. Associated symptoms and signs include back  and leg pain, and progressive orthopedic deformity such as scoliosis or pes  cavus. Neurosurgical exploration and release of the tethered spinal cord may  result in improved urologic function; however, this improvement is often temporary.  In non-ambulatory patients, progressive scoliosis, back pain, and loss of upper  extremity function is often due to an enlarging hydrosyringomyelia. These  patients can greatly benefit from a spinal cord transection immediately above  their tethered neural placode, eliminating the risk for future retetherings.  The future urologic function of these patients is facilitated through  rudimentary spinal cord reflexes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of routine urine cultures is  not encouraged, as any patient undergoing intermittent catheterization will be  colonized with bacteria, therefore, in the absence of pyuria, antibiotics are  not recommended.&nbsp; However, in an  augmented bladder, the Indiana group recommends screening and treating for urease  splitting organisms to prevent the formation of bladder calculi18.&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular urine cytology has  also been advocated as a screening modality for bladder cancer but its utility  has not yet been validated19, 20. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients who have undergone  intestinocystoplasty are also at risk for a metabolic acidosis and annual serum  chemistries have been advocated, as Rosenbaum et al. demonstrated a propensity  to hyperchloremia without a change in CO2 levels21.&nbsp; The loss of the terminal  ileum also places the patient at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, seen in 20%  of the Indiana series, with serum levels normalized by oral replacement21.</p>
  <p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Medical</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Treatment is directed at the two  primary functions of the bladder, the storage of urine and emptying.&nbsp; Modalities can be categorized into  conservative, medical, or surgical.&nbsp;&nbsp; As  per any surgical algorithm, conservative measures are initiated first, medical  and surgical alternatives are sought as conservative measures fail.&nbsp; Over 80% of children with spinal dysraphisms  are successfully managed with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and  anticholinergic therapy alone22.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, our ability to  improve emptying remains crude and is nearly completely reliant upon CIC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Commonplace today, Lapides revolutionized  care of the neuropathic bladder with its introduction23, 24.&nbsp; The inability to catheterize per urethra may  be secondary to sensation, especially in a male, or rarely due to urethral  stricture25, 26.&nbsp; Ineffectiveness may be secondary to family  compliance or a truly hostile bladder.&nbsp;  In infants this is very effectively treated with a cutaneous  vesicostomy, whereas adolescents require another type of urinary diversion,  such as an ileovesicostomy.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second fundamental aspect of  medical therapy involves the use of anticholinergic medications.&nbsp; Muscarinic blockade will suppress detrusor  contractility via the M2 (accounting for 80% of receptors) and M3 (primary  medication of bladder contractility) receptors27, 28.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, blockade is not complete, which may  be due to a third, atypical, neurotransmitter29, 30.&nbsp; Side effects from this class are secondary to  the non-selective nature of the muscarinic receptor: dry mouth, increased  constipation, blurred vision, drowsiness, cognitive dysfunction, and decreased  sweating.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oxybutynin (Ditropan&reg;) is the most  popular and best-studied agent in children, with good efficacy seen in children  and neonates31, 32.&nbsp; Its anti-muscarinic activity is primarily  directed at M1 and M3, but also has muscle relaxant and analgesic properties28, 33.&nbsp; Its addition to CIC resulted in a 70%  increase in urinary continence 34.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dosing regimens vary, with  most literature citing between 0.2-0.6 mg/kg/day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Side effects are seen in up to 1/3 of  patients, the primary cause of discontinuation35.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has recently become  available in an extended release formulation with the advantages of fewer  side-effects and improved efficacy overnight36.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary cause of the side  effects is a metabolite of oxybutynin, (N-desethyl-oxybutynin) which occurs  with a first pass metabolism37.&nbsp; Therefore intravesical and  transdermal strategies have also been effective at reducing side effects.&nbsp; Intravesical administration of a 5 mg tab crushed  and dissolved in 10 ml of normal saline BID has been demonstrated to reduce  intravesical pressures and tolerated better than oral administration38.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, 6 of the 34  children in another study had to discontinue therapy due to drowsiness,  hallucinations, and cognitive effects39.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guerra et al. published a systematic review  whereby they felt that a lack of quality studies prevented them from  recommending intravesical oxybutynin as a viable alternative40.&nbsp; The transdermal formulation  has also been shown to have beneficial effects with better patient compliance  than the immediate release formulation, but not with the extended release  preparation41.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cartwright et al. recently  published a randomized control trial demonstrating comparable increases in many  urodynamics parameters, and a significantly lower level of serum  N-desethyloxybutynin. 12 of the 41 patients receiving the transdermal  preparation reported a rash at the application site42.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tolterodine (Detrol&reg;) is a second  muscarinic antagonist, which is targeted at the M2 and M3 receptor, and has  decreased activity at the M1 receptor in the salivary glands.&nbsp; It has been extensively evaluated in adults,  and efficacy and safety in children has been demonstrated.&nbsp; Goessl used a dose of 0.1 mg/kg divided bid  and reported equal efficacy to immediate release ditropan with decreased side  effects43.&nbsp; Furthermore, in a group of  children unable to tolerate oxybutynin, Bolduc reported 60% able to tolerate  tolterodine (1-2 mg BID) with improvements in bladder function.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solifenacin succinate (Vesicare&reg;) is  targeted primarily to the M3 receptor and has the added advantage of a long &frac12;  life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it may be compounded  into a liquid form, and maintain its daily dosing efficacy; as opposed to  oxybutynin and tolterodine, which require slow-release capsules to achieve 24  hour dosing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard medical doses are often  able to control intravesical pressures sufficiently, but further dose  escalations have been used to attempt to avoid intestinocystoplasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;Bolduc et al. recently published the results  of adding a second full dose anticholinergic to their standard regime, and was  able to demonstrate increase capacity and decrease pressures significantly.&nbsp; Adverse effects were reported as mild in  16/33, moderate in 5/33 and none in 12/3344.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Koff has devised an intriguing  adjuvant to CIC with leaving an indwelling catheter in overnight.&nbsp; By leaving an indwelling catheter overnight,  and the resultant absence of nocturnal over distension and elevated pressures,  he was able to demonstrate a radiographic improvement in 79% of patients with  hydronephrosis45.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Surgical</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surgery may be required if medical  therapy fails to control either of the two fundamental goals of the pediatric  urologist: continence or renal preservation.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Failure of medical management can be secondary to ineffectiveness,  patient compliance, or prohibitive side effects.&nbsp; Multiple effective surgical options exist and  must be tailored to the patients&rsquo; needs, desires, and abilities.&nbsp; The fundamental goal is to provide a  low-pressure storage reservoir with an effective means of emptying.&nbsp; Surgical procedures can be classified as  continent or incontinent, and urinary diversions vs. urinary reservoirs.&nbsp; Urinary diversion may also refer to a  procedure to increase the capacity of the native bladder (bladder augmentation)  where urinary reservoir frequently refers to the replacement of the  bladder.&nbsp; <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urethral dilation has been  re-popularized by the University of Michigan as a means of reducing bladder  pressures in patients who have failed standard conservative treatments48, 49.&nbsp; Kiddoo at al dilated female urethras to a  maximum 36 Fr in 19 patients.&nbsp; Clinical  improvement was seen in 68%, with 6/7 patients demonstrating improvement in  their hydronephrosis, and resolution in one50.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, aggressive urethral  dilation and Botox injection may provide some clinical and urodynamic  improvement in patient after failure of CIC and anticholinergics and may  prevent or delay major reconstructive surgery.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Cutaneous Vesicostomy</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cutaneous vesicostomy is the most common  form of incontinent urinary diversion in neonates and young children.&nbsp; However, this technique has limited use for  older children and adults, as the bladder is much more difficult to mobilize  and secure outside the pelvis.&nbsp; Infants  with a neuropathic bladder and unsafe storage pressures may require vesicostomy  if the patient&rsquo;s caregivers are unwilling or unable to perform CIC, or despite  maximal medical treatment, unable to maintain safe bladder pressures.&nbsp; Several studies have confirmed the  effectiveness of a vesicostomy, with regards to either a reduction in upper  tract dilation or improvement in renal function51-56.&nbsp; Although bacterial colonization of the open  system is expected, symptomatic infection and urosepsis are uncommon52, 54. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although first described by Lapides57, most contemporary surgeons employ the technique described by  Blocksom58 and Duckett59.&nbsp; The Blocksom vesicostomy is  fashioned through a small transverse incision half way between the umbilicus  and the pubis.&nbsp; A vertical incision may  be used if future reconstruction is anticipated, thereby, minimizing excess  cutaneous scar.&nbsp; The fascia is then  incised and the peritoneum is mobilized superiorly off the dome of the  bladder.&nbsp; The urachal remnant is divided  and the dome of the bladder is mobilized to reach the skin without  tension.&nbsp; The fascia is secured to the  bladder wall to form a 24 Fr defect, and the mucosa is everted or sewn flush  with the skin.&nbsp; </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complications of cutaneous  vesicostomy include stomal stenosis, prolapse, peristomal dermatitis, and  bladder calculi.&nbsp; The risk of prolapse is  minimized by limited mobilization of the bladder, and securely suturing the  dome of the bladder to the fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. Dermatitis is  usually a result of a superficial fungal infection, and is effectively managed  with a barrier cream or a topical antifungal.&nbsp;  Bladder calculi may indicate poor drainage, probably secondary to stomal  stenosis, and this should be addressed at the time of stone surgery.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Incontinent Ileovesicostomy</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The incontinent ileovesicostomy (ileal  chimney) was reported by McGuire and associates in 199460, as a variation of the vesicostomy adapted for adults. Because the  adult bladder will frequently not reach the abdominal wall, a segment of ileum  can be anastomosed to the in situ bladder, and brought out as a urinary stoma  (as per an ileal conduit).&nbsp; This allows  for a low-pressure system, the ability to use a urinary appliance, the  avoidance of &ldquo;diapering&rdquo;, and without the inherent complications of the  uretero-intestinal anastomosis.&nbsp; Another  advantage to the incontinent ileovesicostomy is the flexibility regarding body  habitus and position of ostomy, as a significant length of ileum can be used61. Several series report excellent results with regard to  preservation of renal function, incidence of urinary tract infection,  urolithiasis, and stomal complications61-64. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preoperative preparation is  identical to the ileal conduit, with bowel preparation and selection of a stoma  site, usually with the expertise of a stomal therapist.&nbsp; The bladder is bivalved in the coronal plane  and anastomosed to the widely spatulated ileum. A rosebud stoma is fashioned at  the predetermined site and with a large catheter in the stoma and a suprapubic  tube is placed to ensure maximal drainage and irrigation of mucus. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Postoperative complications  secondary to an ileal conduit or chimney can be seen as intermediate in  severity between a vesicostomy / ureterostomy and a continent urinary resevoir.  The use of any intestinal segment predisposes the child to complications  associated with a laparotomy (anastomotic leak, bowel obstruction, etc.) and  effects from the loss of the segment (vitamin malabsorption, diarrhea,  etc.)&nbsp; Intestinal mucus promotes  bacterial colonization and calculus formation in the bladder 65, 66.&nbsp; Due to the non-dependant drainage of the  ileovesicostomy, daily bladder irrigation may be required to reduce  complications from stagnant urine and mucus.&nbsp;  Because the bowel retains its absorptive properties, metabolic acidosis  is a possibility, but less likely than a continent diversion, due to the decreased  pressure and contact time with the bowel mucosa.&nbsp; Malignant degeneration is a concern whenever  the gastrointestinal tract is used in the urinary tract, and although we are  not aware of any cancer reported in association with an ileovesicostomy, the  theoretical risk exists65, 67-69. </p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continent Urinary Diversion</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; When feasible, lower  urinary tract reconstruction in children is facilitated by augmenting the  native bladder, thereby not requiring ureteral implantation into the  neo-bladder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most common, and  effective, means of surgically reducing intravesical pressure and increasing  storage capacity is via intestinocystoplasty70.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although commonly used,  there can be significant morbidity involved, and great care must be taken with  respect to patient selection and pre-operative planning71.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vast majority of augmentations  are performed with gastrointestinal segments, as bowel segments are readily  available and easily configured.&nbsp; Ileum  is currently the most popular segment 72-74, but  sigmoid is often used.&nbsp; Stomach and  ileocecal segments have been used but have only a small role in contemporary  management of the pediatric patient 75-78.&nbsp;&nbsp; The abundance of ileum ensures that adequate  capacity is obtained while detubularization and the natural viscoelastic  properties allows for the low-pressure reservoir 79, 80.&nbsp; However, the secretive81, 82 and  absorptive83 nature of this tissue is also responsible for most of the common  complications associated with this procedure. Maximum storage capacity requires  approximation of the spherical shape79.&nbsp; A widely bivalved bladder  enables this, as well as helps to prevent the augment behaving as a  diverticulum. The volume of the sphere is maximized by folding the ileum into a  U or an S shape, which increases the potential radius and volume84.&nbsp; This reconfiguration, as  well as, detubularization along the antimesenteric border is critical to  disrupting intestinal contractions as the intact intestine can create pressures  of 40-100 cm H2O85-87.&nbsp; The reconstructive surgeon should err on the  side of a larger, rather than smaller augmentation81.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Ileocystoplasty</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Ileum has become the segment of choice  due to its inherently low contractility, abundance, and ease of manipulation72-74.&nbsp; In children 20-30 cm is harvested, with the  distal margin located 15-20 cm from the ileocecal valve to prevent vitamin B12  and bile salt malabsorption 80, 88.&nbsp; A recent abstract presented  by Indiana University reported a 21% incidence of low B12 levels (&lt;200 pg /  ml), with an increasing incidence with increase duration of bladder  augmentation21.&nbsp; However, these responded  very well to oral supplementation, as absorption is known to occur elsewhere  along the intestinal tract.&nbsp; Ileum is  known to produce less mucus than colon and we noted a lower rate of perforation  when compared to sigmoid89.&nbsp; It has the distinct  disadvantage of being difficult to create submucosal tunnels for ureteral  reimplantation or catheterizable channel placement.<br>
<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigmoid Cystoplasty</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Advantages of the sigmoid  include its proximity to the bladder and its marked dilation in the neuropathic  population.&nbsp; Approximately 15-20 cm are  isolated and irrigated with an antibiotic solution.&nbsp; Due to the extreme contractile nature of the  sigmoid, complete detubularization is essential77.&nbsp; Spontaneous perforation  rates have been shown to be higher with sigmoid as opposed to ileal  augmentations90, presumably due to their increased contractile pressure91.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ileocecal  Cystoplasty</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The main advantage of the ileocecal segment is the consistent blood  supply.&nbsp; There are two main techniques,  each with multiple variations.&nbsp; Either  both the ileal and cecal segment are tubularized and reconfigured together, or  solely the cecum is tubularized and the ileum used to create a continent stoma78or for ureteric replacement84.&nbsp; This technique is  infrequently used in the neuropathic population as loss of the ileocecal valve  can result in intractable diarrhea92.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Gastrocystoplasty</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The stomach is much less absorptive then  other intestinal segments and its secretion of hydrogen ions may be beneficial  in patients with chronic renal failure and metabolic acidosis75, 93.&nbsp; A 10-15 cm wedge from the greater curvature  is mobilized along the right gastroepiploic vessel, and passed through the  mesentery of the transverse colon to the bladder.&nbsp; Originally felt to be an option for all  augmentation candidates, its role now is limited those patients with short gut  syndrome to minimize the use of small intestine.&nbsp; This is primarily due to the very problematic  phenomenon of the hematuria dysuria syndrome, occurring in up to 70% of  patients94.</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Complications</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the popularity of using the  gastrointestinal tract as a urinary reservoir, the potential complications are  numerous and can be significant.&nbsp; A broad  categorization of these complications includes: 1) complications due to  structural defects; 2) complications secondary to the loss of the intestinal  segment; 3) complications due to secretions; and 4) complications from  absorption.&nbsp; Because their complications  are similar, and the experience with bladder augmentation is much more  prevalent, much of our data on complications will be from bladder augmentation  series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Structural Complications</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Structural complications include the  requirement for a re-augmentation, spontaneous perforation, and long-term  malignancy potential.&nbsp; A secondary  augmentation was required in 9.4% of augmentations in a series of 500 augmentations70.&nbsp; The most common indication  for re-augmentation was for persistent high intravesical pressures from bowel  contractility95, 96.&nbsp; The hallmark clinical signs  are incontinence or hydronephrosis with screening ultrasound, and this is  confirmed by urodynamic studies.&nbsp;&nbsp; This  complication occurred a mean of 7 years after the original augmentation, and  was least likely when ileum was used70. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever a laparotomy is required;  to perform a urinary diversion incorporating a gastrointestinal segment; this  places the patient at risk for a bowel obstruction, which occurs in  approximately 3% of cases 70, 90, 97, 98.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spontaneous perforation of an  augmented bladder or continent urinary resevoir (CUR) can be a fatal  complication, and must always be a consideration in any patient with a prior  CUR that presents with abdominal pain.&nbsp;  In the immediate postoperative period urinary ascites is likely due to  technical error with the anastomosis, but a late perforation usually originates  in the bowel, approximately 1 cm from the posterior anastomotic line 81.&nbsp; Any delay in presentation,  which is common in the neuropathic population with the high prevalence of  sensory abnormalities, increases the risk of sepsis and death.&nbsp;&nbsp; A high index of suspicion with early and  aggressive diagnostic studies is essential.&nbsp;  Diagnosis is most reliable with a CT cystogram and treatment is usually  by laparotomy and primary closure99.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservative treatment  with catheter drainage has been successful in select patients 100.&nbsp; A higher risk was  calculated whenever sigmoid segments were used and bladder neck surgery was  performed.&nbsp; However, a lower risk  resulted if a catheterizable channel was present101.&nbsp; Although it is commonly  believed that a CUR may be less likely to perforate, the risk may be higher  than previously reported102.&nbsp; Perforation in a Koch  reservoir was reported in 2/20 Swedish children, at 6 and 9 years  post-operatively103.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The risk of malignancy in an  ileocystoplasty has recently been recognized and is an increasing concern68.&nbsp; The malignant potential of combining the  urinary and gastrointestinal tract was first recognized many years after the  popularization of the ureterosigmoidostomy104-108.&nbsp; Malignancy has been since reported in a  variety of urinary diversions, and in all of the gastrointestinal segments, and  have arisen from the intestinal segment, urothelium, or the ureterointestinal  anastomosis67, 109, 110.&nbsp; Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC),  adenocarcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, and benign polyps have all been reported107.&nbsp; Husmann&rsquo;s review of  ureterosigmoidostomy patients reported a 33% mortality rate 107, and although a similar large-scale review of augmented bladders  has not been performed, most reports indicate a very hiAusten and K&auml;lble  published a review of the world literature of all isolated gastrointestinal  urinary diversions in 2004 and found a total of 81 case reports.&nbsp; Their review effectively demonstrated tumors  in a variety of diversions and segments.&nbsp;&nbsp;  In comparing their data to the ureterosigmoidostomy numbers, they  concluded that the augmentations and continent urinary reservoirs (CUR) developed  different malignancies, with a higher proportion of transitional cell  carcinomas (TCC) and other malignancies in augmented bladders. Only 72.6% of  these were adenocarcinoma, whereas nearly all associated with  ureterosigmoidostomy were adenocarcinoma.&nbsp;  Location also varied as ureterosigmoid tumors developed at the  ureterocolonic anastomosis nearly universally, while only 58% did so with the  other diversions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although a tumor has been reported  as soon as three years after augmentation109, 113, the  mean latency is 21.5-26 years.&nbsp; However,  11.9% of reported tumors have occurred within 5 years of augmentation67, 107.&nbsp; Based on data from Indiana University, if the  lag time to malignant degeneration is assumed to be 10 years, then their  estimated incidence would be 1.2%, however, if a 20 year lag-time is used, the  estimated incidence increases to 3.8%111.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The etiology of malignant  degeneration in this population has not been definitively established, but  several theories exist.&nbsp; The carcinogens  responsible for TCC of the native bladder, tobacco in the adult population, are  likely very applicable to this disease, and are potentiated of the effects by  the incorporating the gastrointestinal tract into the urinary tract.&nbsp; Further review by Husmann, encourages all  urologists caring for these patients to be very proactive in counseling against  smoking114.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chronic irritation and inflammation  has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several bladder cancers, including  SCC, TCC and adenocarcinoma.&nbsp; The more  common etiologic agents are long-term indwelling catheters, bladder stones, and  infections.&nbsp; Also, the increased  incidence of polyps, adenocarcinoma, and less frequently SCC in bladder  exstrophy has been attributed to chronic exposure of the urothelium to air and  the resultant inflammation from the abnormal environment. gh mortality rate67, 111, 112.&nbsp; There is significant concern that the number  of reported cases may rise dramatically, as the number of patients at risk is  increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>Austen and K&auml;lble  published a review of the world literature of all isolated gastrointestinal  urinary diversions in 2004 and found a total of 81 case reports.&nbsp; Their review effectively demonstrated tumors  in a variety of diversions and segments.&nbsp;&nbsp;  In comparing their data to the ureterosigmoidostomy numbers, they  concluded that the augmentations and continent urinary reservoirs (CUR) developed  different malignancies, with a higher proportion of transitional cell  carcinomas (TCC) and other malignancies in augmented bladders.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chronic irritation and inflammation  has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several bladder cancers, including  SCC, TCC and adenocarcinoma.&nbsp; The more  common etiologic agents are long-term indwelling catheters, bladder stones, and  infections.&nbsp; Also, the increased  incidence of polyps, adenocarcinoma, and less frequently SCC in bladder  exstrophy has been attributed to chronic exposure of the urothelium to air and  the resultant inflammation from the abnormal environment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any neuropathic bladder requiring  catheter drainage (either indwelling or CIC) will be prone to inflammation  secondary to the bacterial colonization and the presence of a foreign body.&nbsp; Historic data reported the incidence of  bladder cancer in the spinal cord injury population at 2-10%115, but a 1999 review of American Veteran&rsquo;s hospitals found 0.4% of  33,465 patients developed a malignancy over&nbsp;  a 5 year period115.&nbsp; Of the 130 patients with a  cancer, 62% had been managed with an indwelling catheter (suprapubic or  urethral), with 55% of the cancers TCC and 33% SCC.&nbsp; The mean time from spinal cord injury to  malignancy was 23.9 years, and very few occurred in less than 10 years.&nbsp; The CIC cohort was much less likely to  develop SCC, but developed their TCC much sooner, approximately 8 years.&nbsp; This interesting fact speaks to the different  risks associated with the increased inflammation of an indwelling foreign body  vs. the increased contact time with carcinogens with CIC.<br>
Buson et al.  studied 86 rats that had undergone augmentation, and followed them for a  year.&nbsp; Approximately &frac12; had evidence of  metaplasia at autopsy, but no malignancy, and all urine cytology was negative116.&nbsp; Shokier et al. published  their series of 186 patients who underwent continent diversion, secondary to a  number of diseases (including 2 cystectomies for TCC).&nbsp; Of the four patients to develop a secondary  malignancy, all had abnormal cytology, but there is no data regarding the  specificity of the test104.&nbsp; Therefore, we believe there  is good evidence that malignancy can be detected with cytology from an  augmented bladder, but its role in surveillance and prevention in the augmented  bladder needs to be determined19.<br>
<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loss of Intestinal Segment</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The removal of a  gastrointestinal segment for CUR or augmentation is usually well tolerated,  however, bowel dysfunction has been reported in 10-54% of patients117, 118.&nbsp; Removal of the ileocecal valve can result in  problematic diarrhea and rectal incontinence, especially in the neuropathic  population119, 120.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because bile salts are  absorbed in the distal ileum, their increased quantity results in a significant  osmotic gradient and problematic diarrhea 121.&nbsp; However, leaving the distal  15-20 cm of distal ileum intact can usually prevent this.&nbsp; Treatment of mild cases is usually successful  with anion&ndash;exchange resins84.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vitamin B12 deficiency  can develop in up to 35% of patients following an 80 cm small bowel resection  for a Kock pouch122, but it is much less common following ileocystoplasty, perhaps  because it is limited to a 25 cm resection in children21,123, 124.&nbsp; The Swedish series on Koch reservoirs  demonstrated 2/20 patients with serum levels of vitamin B12 below  normal, with 5 patients having low serum folate levels125.&nbsp; Indiana University reported a 21% incidence  of a &ldquo;low&rdquo; B12 level, and this correlated to duration of augmentation.&nbsp; They recently presented an abstract  demonstrating good efficacy with oral replacement126.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Complications Due to Secretions</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gastrointestinal mucosa continue to secret  mucus, and this predisposes the patient to urinary tract infections (UTI) and  bladder stone formation81.&nbsp; Bladder stones occur in  approximately 10-30% of augmentations and CURs127-129. &nbsp;&nbsp;The high incidence of  struvite composition implies a common etiology with a urease-producing  bacteria, although this may also be due to high levels of calcium and phosphate  in mucus130.&nbsp; The systemic acidosis common  to the augmented population, will decrease stone inhibitors, and also promotes  stone growth131.&nbsp; Prevention is aimed at  regular CIC and daily bladder irrigations.&nbsp;  Treatment is amenable to open or endoscopic means127, 131-133, with  open surgery reserved for the larger stones.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The acidic nature of gastric  secretions can result in a hematuria-dysuria syndrome (HDS) in 9-70% of gastric  bladder augmentation patients81, 94, 134, 135.&nbsp; However, this is much less of a problem in a  composite gastro-ileal CUR, as stomal incontinence is much less likely and the  ileal segment helps neutralize the secretions136. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bacteriuria is nearly universal in  any patient performing CIC, especially when combined with mucus from a bowel  segment.&nbsp; A UTI most frequently presents  with malodorous urine, but symptoms also include hematuria, de-novo  incontinence, suprapubic pain, or increased mucus production81.&nbsp; A symptomatic urinary tract  infection is reported by Rink <em>et al</em>.  in 22.7% of patients with an ileal augmentation, while in only 8% of patients  with a gastrocystoplasty90.&nbsp; Treatment of asymptomatic  bacteriuria is not indicated unless culture indicates a urease producing or a  very virulent organism.&nbsp; However,  treatment may decrease the risk of stone formation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Complications  Due to Absorption</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of bowel as a urinary reservoir can  be associated with profound metabolic changes due to its absorptive  nature.&nbsp; Colon and ileum readily absorb  ammonium, hydrogen ion, and chloride and this can result in a hyperchloremic  metabolic acidosis.&nbsp; This is tolerated in  many patients with normal renal function137, but may require medical therapy in others.&nbsp; The extent of ion absorption depends  primarily upon intestinal contact area and length of time for contact,  therefore, significant acidosis should prompt an investigation into incomplete emptying81.&nbsp; Although not all patients  will be frankly acidotic, many will have a rise in their serum chloride levels,  albeit still in the normal range97, 138.&nbsp; The acidosis prompts mobilization of buffers,  and can result in bone demineralization.&nbsp;  While some believe that somatic growth impairment occurs, it remains  controversial.&nbsp; This has been demonstrated  in animal models139-141,  however, in the myelodysplasia population the clinical correlation has been  more difficult to prove.&nbsp; The acidosis  will also result in hypocitraturia, and increase the risk of both renal and  bladder stone formation131. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, medications such as  Dilantin and methotrexate are readily absorbed across the bowel, and levels  must be closely monitored142.&nbsp; Glucose is also absorbed,  making urinary monitoring of hyperglycemia less reliable143.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>TISSUE ENGINEERING</strong><br>
Due to the  significant morbidity inherent to the use of a gastrointestinal segment in the  urinary tract, the promise of a bio-engineered bladder substitute has generated  enormous interest144.&nbsp;&nbsp; The original experiments  used simply a biocompatible scaffold, for example SIS or a collagen matrix145.&nbsp; However, these resulted in excess fibrosis in  the adjacent detrusor tissue84.&nbsp; Anthony Atala has been a  true pioneer within pediatric urology, by first incorporating smooth muscle and  urothelial cells into the scaffold, known as a &ldquo;seeded&rdquo; scaffold; then by  implanting these scaffolds into human patients144.&nbsp; Further progress is  promised with the use of stem cells146 147and the addition of growth factors to encourage normal tissue  development148.&nbsp; Although most clinicians  feel that this field heralds great promise, widespread clinical application  will require a great deal more time and study.</p>
<p><strong>ASSOCIATED SURGERY </strong></p>
<p><strong>Bladder Neck</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the primary indication for  surgery to attain urinary continence, the surgeon must also consider the  urinary sphincter.&nbsp; In cases of mild to  moderate sphincteric competence, decreasing bladder pressures with a bladder  augmentation is often sufficient to result in continence, as bladder pressures  will now be less than the sphincter pressure.&nbsp;  However, in patients with very low leak point pressures, surgical  intervention is required.&nbsp; There are a  myriad of options the surgeon must be familiar with, from minimally invasive to  obliterative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Endoscopic injection of a  bulking agent (Deflux&reg;) can be performed in a retrograde149 or antegrade fashion via&nbsp;  suprapubic access.&nbsp; Long-term  continence (over 7 years) has been reported in up to 40% of patients150, but many series report lower success rates149, 151.&nbsp; Therefore although a minimally invasive  option, proper patient selection is mandatory and its efficacy must be  appreciated.&nbsp; Suburethral slings,  popularized for stress urinary incontinence, can be an excellent alternative  for the moderately competent bladder neck, as they are relatively simple, have  reasonable continence rates, and still allow very good access for urethral  catheterization.&nbsp; Their use in the  neuropathic population, however, usually entails a more aggressive sling, even  a complete wrap around the urethra, and is more occlusive than is seen in  adults with normal bladders.&nbsp; Success  rates are higher if used in concordance with a bladder augmentation152 153, 154and  may also vary with gender and ambulatory status153, 155.&nbsp; The development of out-patient perineal  slings has been popularized in adult literature, and has shown promise in the  properly selected pediatric patient with the neuropathic bladder156. A more definitive reconstruction will involve the tailoring or  reconfiguration of the bladder neck, with a variety of lengthening and  narrowing procedures described with very good success rates154, 157.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the concerns of bladder  deterioration, bladder neck reconstructions have a very high incidence of  concomitant bladder augmentation.&nbsp;  Although originally described for bladder exstrophy, the  Young-Dees-Leadbetter repair remains popular amongst the spinal dysraphism  population, along with the Pippe Salle and Kropp bladder neck repairs154. The ultimate bladder neck surgery to attain continence involves  transection of the bladder neck, which is very effective but requires a  separate outlet for catheterization158.&nbsp; The multiple surgical  options and frequent requirement for bladder augmentation speak to the lack of  an ideal option to increase urethral resistance and attain continence157.</p>
<p><strong>Continent Catheterizable Channels</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continent catheterizable channels  have become very popular over the past decade, as an aggressive approach to the  bladder neck may make spontaneous voiding very difficult, especially if combined  with an intestinocystoplasty.&nbsp;  Catheterizing per urethra more is more difficult after a bladder neck  repair, or the patient confined to a wheel chair.&nbsp; Seattle Children&rsquo;s hospital has published  data confirming patient compliance with CIC is improved with a catheterizable  channel159.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is now known as the  &ldquo;Mitrofanoff Principle&rdquo; states that any supple tube implanted submucosally with  sufficient muscle backing will act as a flap valve, and results in a reliable,  continent cutaneous, catheterizable channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Since Paul Mitrofanoff&rsquo;s landmark paper, the &ldquo;Mitrofanoff Principle&rdquo; has  been widely embraced and applied to a variety of tissues, as the appendix is  not always appropriate or available, especially with the popularity of the  MACE.&nbsp; The use of stomach, colon,  bladder, ureter, and fallopian tube have all been reported with good success160-171.&nbsp; The reconfigured ileal channel was introduced  by Yang166 and Monti 161 and has assumed a leading role in genitourinary reconstruction due  to its reliability with a minimal loss of bowel.&nbsp; Casale introduced the spiral Monti, which  increases the pThe stoma site can  be hidden within the umbilicus or placed in the right lower quadrant, depending  on surgeon preference and patient habitus.&nbsp;  The umbilicus has the advantage of being accessible above the pant line,  but requires a longer intra-abdominal course, with an increased risk of an  intra-abdominal revision173.&nbsp;&nbsp; A stoma in the right lower quadrant ensures  that the detrusor is securely fixed to the abdominal wall, with a shorter  intraperitoneal course, less unsupported channel, and is hypothetically less  likely to result in channel laxity and difficulty of catheterization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many ingenious skin flap techniques have  been employed to minimize the chance of stomal stenosis, all inserting into the  spatulated channel174-176.&nbsp; An indwelling catheter is left for 3 weeks  and the first catheterization is usually performed in the clinic setting.&nbsp; The suprapubic tube is left in situ until  everyone is certain that there are no difficulties with catheterization. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stomal continence is excellent, and  rates of 90-99% are reported in the largest published series163, 177-179.&nbsp; Complications pertain primarily to  difficulties with catheterization, and these can be categorized into those that  occur at the skin level and those deeper, at the entrance to the bladder.&nbsp; This is an important differentiation, as a  skin revision is a simple outpatient procedure, while a deep revision requires  a much more extensive dissection, usually a laparotomy.&nbsp; Stomal stenosis is reported to occur in 5-25%177, 180, with  nearly identical rates between appendiceal and tapered ileum channels163, 181. otential length to 14 cm with a diameter of 12-14 Fr163, 172.</p>
<p><strong>Fecal Continence</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It often falls under the care of the  pediatric urologist to manage the constipation and fecal continence secondary  to the neuropathic bowels.&nbsp; Medical  treatment is dictated by the goal of &ldquo;controlled constipation&rdquo; where the feces  is hard enough for the sphincter to be able to retain it, but soft enough so  that some degree of emptying can occur.&nbsp;  Bowel softeners such as Lactulose and mineral oil are very effective,  whereas PEG-3350 (Miralax&reg;) has the added advantage of being nearly odorless  and tasteless, will not contribute to cavities, and can be mixed in nearly any  liquid.&nbsp; Often, rectal stimulation via  digital touch or suppository is required to create a contraction to evacuate  the feces.&nbsp; Rectal enemas are useful in  some to evacuate the distal aspect of the sigmoid colon, but can be  uncomfortable and difficult for the patient to perform independently.&nbsp; The Peristeen system has recently been  introduced in England and is designed to allow comfortable and independent trans-anal  irrigation with very good continence results182.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as with the bladder, medical  management can be very effective, and surgical alternatives are available when  they fail.&nbsp; The concept of an antegrade  enema via the appendix was introduced by Malone183 and has achieved extreme popularity amongst surgeons and patients  due to the great improvements in quality of life amongst patients and  caregivers184, 185.&nbsp; A minimally invasive alternative has also  been used, whereby interventional radiology places a cecostomy tube into the  proximal colon and flushes occur via a trap-door device, similar to a feeding  tube186, 187.&nbsp; Continence rates and patient satisfaction for  both are excellent, therefore the most important factors in choosing between  the two procedures are: technical expertise, concomitant laparotomy for bladder  reconstruction, tolerance of an external device, and concerns regarding  intrabdominal adhesions and shunt contamination.<br>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contemporary outcomes for patients  with spinal dysraphisms should focus on maximizing quality of life188.&nbsp; With comprehensive spina  bifida clinics the norm for pediatric patients, the vast majority are expected  to reach adulthood.&nbsp; Most of our patients  are able to attend school and the majority graduate from high school with many  pursuing post-secondary education and gainful employment.&nbsp; Therefore, we believe that continence should  be an important goal, although the direct benefit on the patient&rsquo;s quality of  life has been difficult to prove.&nbsp;  Although the protection of the upper urinary tracts and preservation of  renal function has several very effective and low maintenance medical and  surgical alternatives, continence can involve a much greater degree of effort  and surgical complication.</p>
