  <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
Trauma is the leading cause of  mortality in the pediatric population, largely due to motor vehicle accidents  involving children. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a> &nbsp;Injuries to the genitourinary tract are rare,  but are responsible for a variety of associated complications and morbidity.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>&nbsp; The pediatric urologist is rarely the first  physician to evaluate or treat the trauma patient.&nbsp; Instead, urologists are typically consulted  by the emergency department or admitting service following a more comprehensive  evaluation.&nbsp; The aim of this chapter is  to review the most common types of injury throughout the genitourinary tract and  external genitalia with a focus on key features of the initial evaluation,  management and anticipated complications.&nbsp;  Differences between adult and pediatric trauma will be highlighted.</p>
  <p><strong>General Evaluation</strong><br>
    An evaluation of the trauma patient  always begins with a comprehensive history and physical exam if possible.&nbsp; In a child with blunt or penetrating  abdominal trauma, key details for the urologist include the mechanism of  injury, associated multi-organ injury, the presence of hematuria, abdominal or  flank tenderness, rib fractures, and contusions or abrasions.&nbsp; Penetrating injury to the flank, abdomen or  torso is a critical detail and a likely indication for further imaging.&nbsp; The presence of multisystem trauma, gross  hematuria or substantial microscopic hematuria are additional details that also  warrant further investigation.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a><br>
    Unlike in the adult trauma setting, blood  pressure and heart rate are not sensitive indicators of shock in children.&nbsp; Tachycardia may be a result of anxiety or  pain from the trauma and children are capable of compensating for significant  blood loss through vasoconstriction and increased cardiac output.&nbsp; If an injured child&rsquo;s blood pressure does  decrease due to hypovolemia, it is a late sign of instability. For this reason,  adults with blunt trauma and microhematuria without hypotension are often  observed.&nbsp; However, since hypotension is  an unreliable predictor of pediatric renal injury, all children with a history  of significant blunt abdominal trauma and any degree of hematuria should  undergo imaging of the urinary tract regardless of vital signs. <br>
    The physical exam should focus on  abdominal and genital signs of injury. A mass or ecchymosis of the flank may  represent a perinephric hematoma or urinoma. Eccymosis of the perineum in a  butterfly configuration indicates blood tracking within Colles fasica.&nbsp; Scrotal or labial hematoma or edema can  result from genital trauma or pelvic injury.&nbsp;  Blood at the urethral meatus or urinary retention must raise suspicion  for urethral injury. The presence of any of these findings warrant further  evaluation in the stable patient.<br>

  <p><strong><u>Renal Trauma</u></strong><br>
    <strong>Mechanisms</strong><br>
The kidney is the most common site of  injury, resulting in approximately half of all genitourinary injuries in  children.&nbsp; The majority (&gt;80%) of  injuries to the kidney are from blunt trauma while the remaining injuries are  penetrating in nature.4 &nbsp;Falls,  motor vehicle collisions, and pedestrian accidents constitute the overwhelming  majority of childhood renal injury.&nbsp;  Organized sports are an uncommon cause of serious injury. Notably, renal  injury seldom occurs in isolation.&nbsp;  Approximately 80% of all grades of renal injury will have other  associated organ injuries.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
It is thought that the kidney is more  susceptible to blunt trauma in children compared to adults.&nbsp; There are a variety of explanations for this  difference.&nbsp; The kidney is proportionately  larger in children and is less protected by the ribs since it projects more  inferiorly. The ribs in children are also more flexible and are unable to  provide as much protection.&nbsp; Finally  there is less retroperitoneal and peritoneal fat and less developed musculature  to buffer the kidneys in children. Of note, the overall incidence of congenital  renal malformations in series of blunt renal trauma is elevated, ranging from  4-23%. Horseshoe kidneys and kidneys with ureteropelvic junction obstruction,  are at particularly high risk of injury even in the absence of associated organ  injuries or high injury severity scores.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
Hematuria is an important indicator  of injury to the kidney, but represents a significant difference between adult and  pediatric trauma.&nbsp; In adults, very few  renal injuries do not have significant microscopic or gross hematuria at  presentation. For this reason, a threshold of 50 red blood cells (RBC) per  high-power field (HPF) in addition to shock (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm  Hg) is considered a reliable indication for further imaging in adult  trauma.&nbsp; Conversely, over 50% of children  sustaining renal trauma may fail to demonstrate hematuria on presentation.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s higher sympathetic tone and the  less reliable correlation between hematuria and injury dictate a greater  reliance on the clinical history and the presence of associated injuries.&nbsp; Generally agreed upon indications for  radiographic workup in the pediatric trauma patient include 1) penetrating  injury to the abdomen or flank, 2) blunt trauma resulting from significant  deceleration such as a high-velocity motor vehicle collision or fall, 3) blunt  trauma leading to other significant multi-organ injuries and 4) gross hematuria  or microscopic hematuria greater than 50 RBC/hpf. Complete ureteropelvic  junction disruption and renal pedicle injuries to the vessels are classic  examples of significant injury that may present without hematuria. These  insults are typically associated with such significant mechanisms of injury  that further abdominal imaging is warranted to assess for other associated  injuries.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>, <a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a> Notably, the degree of hematuria does not correlate well with severity of renal  injury.1-4 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrast-enhanced  computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality used to assess injury  to the urinary tract and has become the cornerstone of modern staging of blunt  renal injuries.&nbsp; Complete imaging  provides accurate staging, management and prognosis. Most adult facilities have  an established renal protocol including non-contrast, contrast and delayed  phases in order to evaluate the renal blood vessels, parenchyma and the entire  collecting system respectively. While ultrasonography has become an  indispensable modality in pediatrics due to the lack of radiation exposure,  ease of use and relative low cost, it is not reliable in renal trauma  situations.&nbsp; Ultrasonography has  accurately detected only 60% of grade III renal lacerations and appears to be  even less accurate in detecting low grade renal injuries.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a> Ultrasound  is accurate in monitoring perinephric fluid such as urinoma or hematoma,  however.&nbsp; For this reason, it may be more  appropriate to monitor defined injuries with ultrasound following the event  rather than re-imaging with CT scan as is common following adult trauma.3,<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a> The modality and timing of re-imaging following renal trauma is physician  dependent, but generally not necessary for low grade trauma.<br>
<strong>Grading Classification of Blunt Renal  Trauma (Table 1)</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  degree of renal injury is assessed by a grading scale<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a> and is a critical tool in determining appropriate management.&nbsp; Renal contusions or contusions are considered  grade 1 injuries and are the most common injuries to the kidney constituting  80% of renal trauma.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a> Grade I injuries are defined by decreased uptake of contrast material or  subcapsular hematoma.&nbsp; Previously, these  injuries were not detected with older imaging technologies such as intravenous  pyelogram.&nbsp; The advent of CT scans has  dramatically increased the detail and sensitivity of detecting subtle  injury.&nbsp; <br>
Grade II and III renal injuries occur  when the renal parenchyma tears.&nbsp; Tears  less than 1 cm are considered grade II and greater than 1 cm are grade III. These  lacerations are considered minor if they are limited to the parenchyma of the  kidney and do not extend into the collecting system. These injuries will likely  produce more pain and nausea than contusion and may lead to extensive  perinephric hematomas, but there should not be urinary extravasation.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severe  lacerations that extend into the kidney and disrupt the collecting system are  considered grade IV injuries.&nbsp; Bleeding  can be extensive and may fill the Gerota fascia space completely.&nbsp; While the amount of blood may be significant,  this is not necessarily an indication to intervene surgically.&nbsp; As the space within Gerota&rsquo;s fascia fills  with blood, blood loss may be contained and tamponaded by the hematoma itself.  The diagnosis of urinary extravasation also indicates a grade IV injury and  requires delayed imaging by CT scan for accurate diagnosis.&nbsp; Grade IV injury may also result from injury  to the hilar vessels with contained hemorrhage. The mechanism of injury is  classically rapid deceleration leading to stretching of the adventitia and  muscularis.&nbsp; The intima of the vessel is  not so elastic, however, and may tear more readily.&nbsp; Intimal tears expose the muscularis to rapid  blood flow and can clot off the renal artery or vein.&nbsp; While hematuria may be absent in these  situations, the mechanism of injury is typically so significant that other  organ injuries are present.&nbsp; While the  parenchyma may be intact, perfusion will be compromised and asymmetric compared  to the unaffected side.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Wide separation of multiple renal  fragments indicates a &ldquo;shattered kidney&rdquo; and is the most common appearance of a  grade V injury.&nbsp; It can be difficult to  determine what segments are poorly perfused due to severe contusion and what  tissue may be truly devitalized. Massive bleeding and extravasation within  Gerota&rsquo;s fascia is common.&nbsp; Major hilar  injury leading to devascularization also defines grade V renal injuries. The  warm ischemia time inherent to this type of injury makes salvage unlikely and  surgery is generally reserved for nephrectomy in order to stabilize active  hemorrhage.&nbsp; Even under ideal circumstances,  salvage rates for kidneys with renal pedicle injuries are below 30%.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""> </a></p>
  <p><strong>Management</strong><br>
Current management of renal injuries  has shifted towards a non-operative approach with up to 85% of blunt renal  injuries managed nonoperatively.4 Goals of either a conservative or  surgical approach should focus on preservation of renal tissue and kidney  function while minimizing the morbidity and mortality of the injury to the  child.&nbsp; Conservative management is  appropriate for lower grades of renal injury (I-III) and commonly involves bed  rest until hematocrit measurements have stabilized and hematuria has  resolved.&nbsp; Monitoring of vital signs is  imperative to assess hemodynamic stability. Following discharge, limited  activity should be recommended for 2 to 6 weeks according to the clinician&rsquo;s  impression.&nbsp; This approach has proven to  be highly successful in avoiding long-term complications such as hypertension,  loss of renal function and hydronephrosis.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Re-evaluation with ultrasound can reliably  detect an expanding urinoma or hematoma.&nbsp;  Patients that decline clinically or are unstable may require additional  CT imaging and possible intervention such as exploration with an attempt at  renal repair, placement of a ureteral stent or angiographic embolization.&nbsp; <br>
The management of severe renal injury  (grades IV-V) is more controversial and requires an individualized  approach.&nbsp; A significant consideration is  that surgical intervention may lead to nephrectomy rates over 85%.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a> Patients who are hemodynamically stable with isolated high-grade renal injuries  are candidates for non-operative management.&nbsp;  Nonetheless, surgery is indicated for patients with a vascular pedicle  injury or shattered kidney that place the patient at risk for life-threatening  hemorrhage.&nbsp; Absolute indications for  operative intervention also include an expanding or pulsatile retroperitoneal  hematoma and the inability to stop hemorrhage by selective angioembolization.  Relative indications for exploration are significant urinary extravasation,  non-viable renal tissue, arterial injury and expanding hematoma or if accurate  staging is non-possible. Surgical management should first focus on control of  the renal pedicle and aorta.&nbsp; When  hemostasis is achieved, inspection of the kidney and collecting system can be performed.  Devitalized tissue should be debrided and any defects in the parenchyma closed  and covered if possible.&nbsp; Partial  nephrectomy to preserve viable parenchyma is the operation of choice.&nbsp; Urinary extravasation can be managed with a  ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube.&nbsp; A  successful outcome for emergency repair of a severe pedicle injury or  thrombosis is unlikely given the amount of warm ischemia the injured kidney  will undergo during the evaluation and resuscitation of the patient.&nbsp; Attempts at salvage in these situations  should be limited to extreme circumstances such as a solitary kidney or  bilateral renal injuries.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<strong>Penetrating Trauma</strong><br>
It is important to note that the  outcomes for penetrating injury are generally less favorable than for blunt  injury.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a> These types of injuries are typically from gunshot or stab wounds and the  incidence is rising among children, particularly in inner-city adolescent boys.29  Compared to blunt trauma patients, patients with penetrating trauma are more  severely injured, with a greater likelihood of requiring blood transfusionand  nephrectomy &nbsp;.&nbsp; Overall, the rate of surgery for penetrating  renal injury is approximately 36%4,28,<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a> in comparison to exploration rates under 10% for blunt injury.3,4,27&nbsp; While stab wounds and low-velocity gunshot  wounds may cause precise localized injury, high-velocity gunshot wounds are  notorious for causing a blast-effect leading to difficulty in determining the  true extent of injury on initial evaluation.&nbsp;  In all cases of penetrating trauma, broad-spectrum antibiotics are  recommended to avoid wound infection.<br>
<strong>Complications</strong><br>
There are a variety of early and late  complications associated with renal injury.&nbsp;  The most significant early complications include bleeding, infection and  urinary extravasation/urinoma.&nbsp; The risk  of bleeding is highest immediately following the trauma and admission for close  observation is necessary.&nbsp; Strict bed  rest and serial hematocrits are the mainstay of treatment for conservative  management of low grade renal injuries. &nbsp;This should be continued until resolution of  gross hematuria and stabilization of hematocrit levels.&nbsp; Signs of hemodynamic instability, including  hypovolemia and severe hypotension that does not respond to blood transfusion,  should prompt consideration of surgical exploration or angiography with  potential embolization.&nbsp; Primary  angioembolization may reduce the morbidity associated with surgical  exploration, and is useful for segmental artery bleeding or delayed hemorrhage.  The risk of secondary or delayed hemorrhage is not insignificant. Classically,  bleeding may recur 1-2 weeks following trauma, but can occur up to a month  later.&nbsp; This risk may be as high as 25%  of patients with grade 3-4 renal trauma who are managed conservatively.19,<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a> Delayed bleeding is usually due to the development of an arteriovenous  malformation or pseudoaneurysm.&nbsp; Unlike  fistula or pseudoaneurysm formation following renal biopsy, spontaneous  resolution following trauma is unlikely and the need for surgical intervention  is high. &nbsp;Angiographic embolization of an  isolated renal artery is an increasingly common technique to address this  complication with success rates of approximately 80%.13,19,<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a><br>
Infection must be a consideration  whenever there is a hematoma, urinoma or devitalized parenchyma. Large amounts  of devitalized tissue exceeding 25% of the affected kidney put patients at  particularly high risk for clinically significant urine leak, hematoma and  perinephric abscess.&nbsp; Delayed recognition  of an infected hematoma, urinoma or perinephric abscess places the patient at  risk for sepsis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Children should be  treated with parental antibiotics initially, followed by an appropriate oral  antibiotic; however abscess formation must be definitively treated by  percutaneous or open drainage.<br>
Extravasation of urine is a sign of  renal pelvis laceration, a significant parenchymal tear extending into the  collecting system, or avulsion of the UPJ.&nbsp;  Complete UPJ disruption is rare, but is associated with significant  deceleration injuries such as motor vehicle collisions or falls from  significant heights.&nbsp; While spontaneous  resolution of urinomas have been reported in up to 75% of children even with  severe grade IV lacerations,<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a> complete disruption requires immediate operative repair.&nbsp; Serial imaging, typically by ultrasound is  adequate for monitoring the size of a urinoma.&nbsp;  Indications for a ureteral stent or percutaneous drainage of the  collecting system include symptomatic and worsening extravasation.&nbsp; A relative indication for stenting is failure  of the urinoma to resolve with conservative management.&nbsp; The strategy of conservative management with  or without endoscopic drainage is effective in resolving &gt;90% of urinomas.38,<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> </a><br>
The most significant late  complications of renal trauma include hypertension and loss of renal  function.&nbsp; Hypertension in children  following renal injury is rare (&lt;1-2%), but long-term monitoring of blood  pressure is important to exclude the need for medical or surgical management.32,<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""> </a> The development of a fibrous capsule around the injured kidney is the likely  mechanism for renin-mediated hypertension.&nbsp;  The restricted blood flow by parenchymal compression has been termed a  &ldquo;Page Kidney&rdquo; and is likely due to a prolonged urine leak or urinoma.&nbsp; Additional mechanisms for renin-mediated  hypertension include stenosis of the renal artery or one of its branches or a  persistent post-traumatic arteriovenous fistula.&nbsp; Medical management is usually successful  until the underlying etiology resolves spontaneously, but the duration of this  strategy is unknown and surgical intervention may ultimately be necessary.&nbsp; In these rare cases, options include vascular  or endovascular reconstructions of arterial malformations.&nbsp; Rarely, capsulotomy or nephrectomy may be  attempted. <br>
Preservation of functional renal  parenchyma is one of the foremost goals of renal trauma management.&nbsp; This may be less successful in children with  renovascular trauma or with high grade injury.&nbsp;  While conservative management of low grade trauma (grades I-III)  typically leads to complete healing, Grades IV and V show some volume loss (22%  and 50% respectively). 44,<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Surprisingly, even segments of a  shattered kidney frequently retain blood supply and remain viable.&nbsp; Over time, these kidneys can reconstitute  themselves in good alignment although they may have morphological changes that  persist, including scars <strong>(Figure 1)</strong>,</p>

  <p> cysts or segmental hydronephrosis.&nbsp;  Nuclear medicine studies such as MAG3 or DMSA may be done in order to  document or track recovery over time, although the results are unlikely to  affect management.&nbsp; It is difficult to  determine the true functional outcome soon after the traumatic event since some  segments with contusions may not take up contrast during the initial CT  scan.&nbsp; If given time to recover, these  segments may eventually demonstrate function.&nbsp;  As long as a healthy contralateral kidney exists, the risk of  post-traumatic renal failure is low.44 </p>
  <p><strong><u>Ureteral Injury</u></strong><br>
    <strong>Mechanism</strong><br>
The incidence of ureteral injury is  uncommon, constituting less than 3% of genitourinary trauma.45,<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a> The ureter is largely protected by its retroperitoneal location and close  proximity to the vertebral column, paraspinal muscles, and the bony pelvis. It  is also a small target and inherently mobile. Severe blunt injury, classically  from significant deceleration, may cause disruption of the ureteropelvic  junction. Penetrating injury, such as gunshot wounds or stab wounds, is more  common and will be associated with other organ injury in 97% of cases.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a> Gunshot  wounds, in particular, are capable of injuring the ureter even if it is outside  the path via a blast effect. Finally, iatrogenic injury is possible in  laparoscopic, pelvic, or endoscopic procedures.&nbsp;  Recognition at the time of injury is critical to minimize sequelae.<br>

A high index of suspicion for  ureteral injury must be maintained to avoid missing the diagnosis and the  urologist must be cognizant of the risk of delayed necrosis.&nbsp; Hematuria may be present in only 23-45% of  cases and CT scans may miss up to 75% of cases.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a> Delayed images are imperative to visualize contrast throughout the collecting  system <strong>(Figure 2)</strong>.</p>

  <p> Intraoperative  evaluation does not always identify a clear injury.&nbsp; If there is concern for an occult ureteral  injury, identification of the ureters by passing a ureteric catheter can be  helpful, particularly in a difficult dissection or reoperation.&nbsp; Alternatively, administration of  indigo-carmine or methylene blue and endoscopic inspection of the ureteral  orifices can confirm an intact collecting system.<br>

    <strong>Management</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  timing and specific intervention for ureteral injury depend on factors such as  the timing of diagnosis, the severity of injury and the patient&rsquo;s overall  condition.&nbsp; Repair principals are similar  to that of adult ureteral injury.&nbsp; Early  recognition of an injury, such as an intraoperative iatrogenic injury, should  prompt immediate repair.&nbsp; Key features of  an appropriate ureteral repair consist of a tension free, spatulated  anastomosis.&nbsp; Devitalized segments should  be excised to reapproximate healthy edges.&nbsp;  Repair over a ureteral stent may prevent transient obstruction from  edema or hematoma and aid the healing process.&nbsp;  In cases where direct reanastamosis is not possible, options include  further mobilization of the kidney and ureter, psoas hitch or Boari flap with  or without ureteral reimplantation, and transuretero-ureterostomy. These  considerations may be dictated by the location and extent of the injury.  Nephrectomy can be avoided even for the longest ureteral insults by ileal  transposition.&nbsp; <br>
Delayed  recognition of ureteral injuries is common and presents a more complex  management problem.&nbsp; If the injury is  recognized within 5-7 days, surgical intervention remains an option.&nbsp; If outside of this window, reconstruction  should be delayed several months.&nbsp;  Temporary diversion with a nephrostomy tube or internal stenting can  bridge this gap or be used in an unstable patient unfit for surgery.&nbsp; Conservative initial management may allow the  injury to heal without need for surgical intervention.&nbsp; In a series of 46 patients with ureteral  injuries treated with nephrostomy, 44% of those patients needed no other  treatment.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a> <br>
<strong>Complications</strong></p>
  <p>If a significant ureteral injury is not  addressed properly, the primary complication is urinary extravasation into the  retroperitoneum resulting in urinoma or abscess formation.&nbsp; Initial management in this situation includes  drainage with a nephrostomy tube or prolonged ureteral stent with percutaneous  drainage of the urinoma or abscess.&nbsp;  Ureteral strictures are a particularly troublesome long term  complication.&nbsp; Their presentation may be  insidious and serial ultrasound imaging following ureteral injury is imperative  to rule out progressive hydronephrosis and signs of obstruction.&nbsp; A ureteral stent is adequate to resolve  obstruction immediately, and may resolve uncomplicated or short strictures  permanently.&nbsp; Additional conservative  measures for short strictures include balloon dilatation and  endoureterotomy.&nbsp; Stricture length over  1cm or multiple strictures are risk factors for recurrent or persistent  stricture after endoscopic management.&nbsp;  This may be related to prior infection, prolonged extravasation or  inadequate blood supply.&nbsp; Open or  laparoscopic reconstruction should be considered in these cases. </p>
  <p><strong><u>Bladder and Urethral Injury </u></strong><br>
    <strong>Mechanisms</strong><br>
Pediatric bladder and urethral trauma  are usually associated with other severe injuries that include pelvic  fracture.&nbsp; Consequently, mortality rates  are higher.&nbsp; Motor vehicle collisions are  a leading cause of pelvic blunt trauma and inappropriately fastened lap belts  may increase the risk of bladder injury.&nbsp;  Compared to the adult setting, the bladder in a child is located in a  more abdominal position, particularly when full.&nbsp; This anatomic difference makes the pediatric  bladder more susceptible to external injury. The less developed rectus  abdominal muscles also offer less protection. Meanwhile, the elasticity and  location of the urethra makes it more resistant to injury.&nbsp; The bony pelvis and perineum protect the bladder  as well as the posterior urethra, including the bladder neck, the prostatic  urethra, the membranous urethra, and the bulbous urethra in males.&nbsp; In adults, the prostate supports the urethra,  but in boys the prostate is not yet developed and increases the risk of  posterior and bladder neck injuries.&nbsp; No  matter what the site of injury, bladder and urethral injuries are capable of  producing a considerable amount of blood loss into the pelvis and perineum.  Large pelvic hematomas may cause a mass effect significant enough to cause urinary  retention. The collection of exstravasated blood and may also be large enough  to force disrupted urethral edges apart.<br>
Both bladder and urethral injuries  are typically associated with pelvic fractures from severe blunt trauma.&nbsp; If the pelvic ring is disrupted, shear forces  can disrupt the pelvic floor and are capable of pulling the membranous urethra  away from bladder and prostate. The membranous urethra is the most common site  of injury and is most frequently injured from straddle fractures causing pubic  diastasis of the sacroiliac joint.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a> However,  children are capable of sustaining injuries that are uncommon in adults due to  their anatomical differences.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a> The  immature prostate and weaker puboprostatic ligaments make the prostatic urethra  and bladder neck more susceptible to disruption.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a> For  this reason, longitudinal tears though the bladder neck and sphincteric complex  are more common in children than in adults.<br>
The classic injury to the bulbous  urethra is from straddle injury. They can occur from bicycles, playground  equipment and falling over bars or fences. Kicking or assault to the perineum  are less common, but also capable of producing clinically significant straddle  injury.&nbsp; The mechanism of injury occurs when  the urethra and surrounding corpus spongiosum are crushed against the pubic  rami.&nbsp; <br>
<strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
The hallmark signs of bladder and  urethral injury are suprapubic pain, tenderness, inability to urinate, gross  hematuria and blood at the urethral meatus.&nbsp;  Indications for imaging the bladder include the presence of gross  hematuria and/or urinary retention in conjunction with a pelvic fracture.&nbsp; Notably, the mere presence of gross hematuria  or an isolated pelvic fracture is not an absolute indication for  bladder-specific imaging. The majority of injuries that present solely with  hematuria will likely be simple bladder contusions, which do not require any  specific workup or treatment.&nbsp; All  penetrating injury concerning for bladder injury should prompt imaging to rule  out bladder injury.<br>
Most urethral injuries from a  straddle mechanism do not cause significant extravasation of urine because the  urethra is crushed as opposed to lacerated. However, bleeding into the perineum  can be substantial and leads to the pathognomonic &ldquo;butterfly pattern&rdquo; by  spreading within the limits of Colles fascia. Although digital rectal  examination has historically been performed to assess for the presence of the  concurrent rectal or prostatic injury, recent studies have shown that digital  rectal examination is less than 15% accurate in diagnosing either a displaced  prostate injury or rectal injury.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Consequently, the trauma and emergency  medicine communities have abandoned this aspect of the evaluation of the trauma  patient. Instead, diagnosis should be made by either endoscopic visualization  or appropriate radiographic imaging.&nbsp;  These investigations should be prompted by suggestive signs or symptoms  (perineal/penile hematoma, blood at the meatus or vaginal introitus, inability  to void), in the setting of a pelvic fracture or symphyseal diastases or when  prior imaging studies are suggestive of urethral or bladder neck injury.<br>
The initial trauma CT scan may not be  adequate to completely characterize lower urinary tract injury.&nbsp; The urethra will not have contrast material  within it and delayed phase imaging must demonstrate an adequately full bladder.&nbsp; Other modalities to assess bladder injury  include cystography or intravenous pyelography.&nbsp;  Oblique and post-drainage films should be included.&nbsp; CT cystography is perhaps the most sensitive  and specific test but involves significant radiation exposure and should be  used judiciously<strong> (Figure 3)</strong>.</p>
  <p><img width="383" height="292" src="urinary_tract_trauma_clip_image002_0001.jpg"><br>
    <strong>Figure 3</strong>: Exraperitoneal Bladder Injury from  CT cystogram.</p>
  <p><strong> &nbsp;</strong>No  matter which modality is chosen, the bladder should be filled to at least 50%  capacity and should stop at the maximum of estimated bladder capacity.&nbsp; Common equations for estimating the pediatric  bladder capacity are (Age+2)x30mls and Kilograms x 7mls in infants less than 1  year old. The classic appearance of an intraperitoneal bladder injury on  cystogram is a starburst pattern of contrast outlining loops of bowel. <strong>(Figure 4)</strong></p>

    <strong>Figure 4</strong>: Intraperitoneal Bladder injury from  Cystogram</p>
  <p><br>
    The retrograde urethrogram has long  been the best imaging study for investigating the urethra.&nbsp; Oblique views are necessary to rule out  posterior extravasation and complete continuity of the urethra.&nbsp; A Foley catheter may be placed into the  bladder under radiographic guidance in cases of an intact urethra with a small  tear.&nbsp; If a catheter has been placed  previously, it should not be removed.&nbsp; A  feeding tube can be placed in the meatus alongside the catheter in order to perform  the study and assess injury.&nbsp;  Alternatively, if the patient has already voided and examination does  not suggest urethral injury, a urethral catheter can be placed immediately  without a retrograde study.<br>
    <strong>Management: Extraperitoneal vs  Intraperitoneal Bladder Injury</strong><br>
    The primary clinical distinction in  bladder injury is determining an intraperitoneal vs extraperitoneal injury  site. Intraperitoneal rupture accounts for approximately 1/3 of cases.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a> Children  with intraperitoneal rupture may develop hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and  elevated serum urea and creatinine.&nbsp; Intraperitoneal  rupture is less common and typically occurs at the dome of the bladder.&nbsp; While intraperitoneal rupture is generally an  indication for operative intervention, this decision is somewhat controversial  in children.&nbsp; Successful nonoperative  management may be reasonable for small, isolated injuries<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a> This decision may be an option for stable patients with small injuries who can  be observed carefully.&nbsp; Laparotomy for  other associated injuries is an opportunity to inspect the bladder and repair  any injuries. <br>
    Extraperitoneal rupture is more  commonly associated with pelvic fracture, but this is rare and may occur in  less than 1% of cases.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a> This  incidence is significantly lower in children, which is attributed to more  elastic pelvic attachments. The vast majority of extraperitoneal injuries can  be managed by catheter drainage alone.&nbsp;  If gross hematuria persists or worsens during this period, open repair can  be considered. Furthermore, the presence of a bony spicule necessitates  operative intervention. <br>
    Conservative management should be  similar regardless of the injury site.&nbsp;  Continuous bladder drainage is typically continued for 10-14 days in  cases of conservative management and 7-10 days following operative repair.&nbsp; Confirmation of adequate healing can be  confirmed by a negative cystogram prior to catheter removal. </p>
  <p><strong>Management: Urethral Injury</strong><br>
Management strategies of urethral  injury are largely dependent on the anatomic location.&nbsp; The most important acute goals are minimizing  infectious complications with broad-spectrum antibiotics, assessing the  competence of the bladder neck, and establishing urinary drainage. The  management of bulbous or anterior urethral injuries is typically simple and involves  either observation or urethral catheter drainage alone.&nbsp; These patients typically follow a course of  transient dysuria and hematuria and the issue resolves with conservative  management. The primary risk may be the eventual development of urethral stricture.&nbsp; <br>
The initial management of posterior  urethral injuries is more complex.&nbsp; If  possible, placement of a urethral catheter helps alignment and provides bladder  drainage. In cases of complete disruption and urethral disassociation, urethral  catheter placement may not be possible.&nbsp; Appropriate  management in this scenario remains controversial, with accepted options  including immediate primary realignment of the urethra or suprapubic drainage  and delayed reconstruction.&nbsp; It is now  generally accepted that the ultimate course is a result of the initial trauma  itself, rather than the repair strategy. If a delayed repair strategy is  employed, continuous drainage should be employed at least 6-8 weeks before  urethroplasty. A retrograde urethrogram can be performed before repair to aid  in surgical planning. If a suprapubic catheter is available, a cystogram maybe  concurrently performed to more accurately determine the stricture length or  defect between disrupted urethral ends. Any subsequent recurrent strictures are  likely to be milder in severity and likely to respond to dilation or endoscopic  urethrotomy.64-66 Repair of recurrent strictures should be delayed  for 4-6 months to allow for optimal neovascularization. <br>
<strong>Special Considerations:</strong><br>
Involvement of the bladder neck,  prostate or vagina significantly affects management.&nbsp; Injury to these structures require immediate  formal repair. Unfortunately, these injuries are more common in children. Early  repair minimizes the risk of long term complications including stricture,  incontinence and fistula.&nbsp; Tears  involving the posterior bladder and vagina are at particularly high risk for  vesicovaginal fistula.&nbsp; In this scenario,  opening the bladder improves exposure.&nbsp;  The bladder should then be drained by both urethral and suprapubic tube  placement.&nbsp; An omental flap positioned  between the bladder and vaginal repairs may reduce the risk of fistula  formation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It  is important to note that trauma to the female urethra is extremely rare due to  its shorter length and protected location.&nbsp;  Injury is typically associated with severe pelvic fractures and  extensive injury to the vagina.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a> The  injury may occur as a transverse disruption or as a longitudinal tear extending  from the bladder neck or urethra.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a> Labial edema and hematoma as well as vaginal injury also typically accompany  female urethral injury.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a> Management  principals are similar to boys.&nbsp; If the  bladder neck is intact and a catheter can be placed per urethra, the injury may  be treated conservatively. If catheter placement is not possible, a primary vs  delayed strategy with suprapublic drainage may be employed. However, due to the  shorter urethral length, it is usually possible to place a catheter either  retrograde or antegrade to realign the damaged urethra.&nbsp; If the injury traverses the bladder neck or  involves the vagina, immediate repair is indicated. Long-term outcomes  following female urethral injury are poor, likely due to the violent mechanism  required to fracture the pelvis and tear the soft tissue attachments. Moderate  or severe lower urinary tract symptoms may occur in 43% of patients and sexual  dysfunction may occur in 38%.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a><br>
<strong>Complications</strong><br>
Acute complications of bladder and  urethral injury include persistent gross hematuria, clot retention and pelvic  abscess.&nbsp; Hematuria is typically  self-limiting but may require intermittent or continuous irrigation.&nbsp; Abscess or urinoma can be drained  percutaneously. Intraperitoneal rupture can result in peritonitis or ileus,  especially in the setting of delayed diagnosis and management. Bladder spasms  and urge incontinence are also common in the immediate post-trauma period.&nbsp; <br>
Late complications are uncommon but  can include urinary fistula, persistent lower urinary tract symptoms or  persistent incontinence.&nbsp; In males,  erectile dysfunction is related to nerve damage from wide separation of the  pubic bones. Bladder stones are a possibility if permanent sutures were used  and exposed within the urothelium. <br>
Stricture is the most significant  complication following urethral trauma. Since posterior urethral injury in  children may involve the bladder neck, prostatic urethra and sphincteric  complex, associated complications have been high.&nbsp; Historic outcomes from immediate surgical  repair demonstrate high rates of incontinence (21%) and impotence (56%).<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a> In  an effort to improve these results, many advocate suprapubic drainage followed  by delayed or late reconstruction.&nbsp;  Suprapubic drainage following complete urethral disruption will  inevitably lead to significant stricture and the eventual need for open  urethroplasty.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a> Data regarding success rates of late urethroplasty is most robust in the adult  literature and suggest re-stricture rates of 11-30%.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Continence rates may be as high as 90% and  impotence remains over 50%.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a> &nbsp;<br>
Experience with late urethroplasty in  children is limited.&nbsp; In a series of 68  boys with posterior urethral injuries from pelvic fracture managed by delayed  repair, only 10% experienced urethral re-stricture or incontinence.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a> Other series of posterior urethral injuries comparing late and immediate repair  suggest incontinence rates less than 10%, impotence less than 20%, and widely  ranging re-stricture rates regardless of the management strategy.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""> </a> &nbsp;&nbsp;Impotence appears to be directly  related to the degree of public diastasis.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""> </a> No matter what repair strategy is employed, long-term outcomes following female  urethral injury are poor due to the violent mechanism required to fracture the  pelvis and tear the soft tissue attachments. Moderate or severe lower urinary  tract symptoms may occur in 43% of patients and sexual dysfunction may occur in  38%.<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""> </a></p>
  <p><strong><u>Penile Injury</u></strong><br>
      <strong>Mechanism</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patterns of penile injury are  largely determined by patient age. Penile injuries in the neonate are most  commonly iatrogenic 2.&nbsp; The  risk of circumcision-related injury due to clamp (e.g. Mogen, Gomco,  Plastibell) circumcision is approximately 0.2% and ranges in severity from mild  penile skin loss to significant glans or urethral injuries.<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Self-inflicted or non-iatrogenic pediatric  penile injuries are rare.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Zipper injuries may result in contusion or  pressure necrosis of the prepuce.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""> </a> The &ldquo;hair tourniquet&rdquo; may lead to preputial edema edema and inflammation and,  less commonly, more significant injury to the corpora or urethra.2&nbsp;&nbsp; As children reach toddler age and begin  toilet training, toilet seat injuries become common.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Similar contusions or lacerations can occur  from rubber band powered toys during bathtub playtime in this population.&nbsp; Penile lacerations and amputations have been  reported from dog or other animal bites.<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Finally, blunt perineal trauma is the most  common etiology for high-flow priapism secondary to a traumatic arteriovenous  fistula.<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""> </a></p>
  <p><strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The etiology of external  genitalia injury is rarely subtle.&nbsp; The  extent of circumcision injury can almost always be assessed by the external  appearance.&nbsp; The amount of excised penile  skin should be assessed and injury to the glans or urethra noted. Constricting  agents, such as hair tourniquet, may require closer inspection. If there is  concern for more proximal urethral injury, a retrograde urethrogram can be  considered.&nbsp; Animal attacks may be the  most significant injuries seen in childhood.&nbsp;  Verification of the animal&rsquo;s tetanus and rabies vaccination status is  necessary. Determination of high vs low-flow priapism is relatively easy to  distinguish from a thorough history and physical exam.&nbsp; High-flow priapism follows perineal trauma,  is non-painful and the corporal bodies are usually tumescent but not completely  rigid.&nbsp; If the diagnosis is unclear,  cavernosal blood gas testing can be performed.<br>
    <strong>Management</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Superficial contusions and  lacerations can typically be managed with topical antibiotic ointments, but may  require minor debridement and skin approximation depending on the mechanism,  patient anxiety level, and severity of injury.81&nbsp;&nbsp; Empiric antibiotics may be prescribed to  decrease the risk of cellulitis, although there is little data to support this  practice.&nbsp; If significant penile skin is  lost due to neonatal circumcision, full thickness skin grafting of the excised  prepuce or shaft skin may be performed in the immediate post-injury period.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>&nbsp; The majority of cases can be managed by  healing through secondary and antibiotic ointment, although this strategy may  involve frequent, painful dressing changes.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zipper injuries to the penis more  commonly occur in uncircumcised boys and may be treated with mineral oil to  slip the trapped skin from the zipper80 or by cutting of the median  bar of the zipper with bone cutters.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>&nbsp; In cases where conservative measures are  inadequate, operative intervention may be necessary.&nbsp; Devitalized skin should be excised with  primary reapproximation or healing by secondary intention in cases of delayed  presentation or concern for contamination.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>&nbsp; However, most procedures may be performed in  the emergency room under local anesthesia.&nbsp;  The use of a benzodiazepine such as midazolam may facilitate  examination.&nbsp; Formal conscious sedation  is not generally required.2&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tourniquet injuries are generally  superficial, but may extend to the corporal bodies or urethra.&nbsp; Often the initial diagnosis is mistaken for  balanitis or paraphimosis due to significant associated preputial edema.&nbsp; Prompt removal of the constricting band may  require an exam under anesthesia for adequate exposure.&nbsp; Identifying a hair tourniquet may be  particularly difficult, especially in the case of blond hairs.&nbsp; Loupe magnification during an exam under  anesthesia helps considerably in this situation.&nbsp; Local wound care may be used for isolated  skin necrosis, while more severe cases of corporal injury may require primary  repair of cavernosal defects to minimize the risk of fibrosis and preserve  erectile function.2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amputation injuries may be managed  with primary reanastamosis up to 8 hours after injury.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>&nbsp; <strong>(Figure  5)</strong>&nbsp;</p>

  <p> Buccal mucosa grafting has been  suggested to reapproximate the coronal sulcus and provide an improved cosmetic  result in cases of glans amputation.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Partial amputation injuries may be treated  nonoperatively with intermittent application of epinephrine-soaked sponges to  control hemorrhage in the absence of associated urethral injury.&nbsp; If urethral involvement is present, formal  hypospadias repair may be required.85&nbsp;&nbsp; As with any other body part, the amputated  penis should be cooled as quickly as possible to reduce ischemic injury. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Genital injury due to animal bite  should be assessed under anesthesia to fully assess the extent of trauma.&nbsp; Broad spectrum antibiotics and tetanus  prophylaxis should be administered prior to treatment.82&nbsp;&nbsp; Debridement of devitalized tissue and  aggressive irrigation of the wound have been shown to reduce the risk of wound  infection from 59% to 12%.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a> Split thickness skin grafts should be applied to denuded areas to minimize  wound contraction.&nbsp; Investigation for  potential abuse or neglect should be initiated in these cases to reduce the  risk of future injury.82&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High-flow priapism may be managed  nonoperatively with spontaneous resolution reported within days to weeks after  injury.83&nbsp;&nbsp; If conservative  measures fail, embolization with autologous clot is the preferred treatment.  However, up to 44% of patients may recur.&nbsp;  In cases of recurrence, repeat embolization with nonabsorbable materials  may be attempted.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Open surgical ligation is a measure of last  resort due to the high risk of associated erectile dysfunction.83<br>
    <strong>Complications</strong><br>
    Acute complications of penile trauma  include bleeding and infection, particularly in cases of animal bites. Late  complications of penile injury include penile trapping, distal urethral or  meatal stenosis, and unsatisfactory cosmetic outcomes. However, post  circumcision healing in the neonatal period is generally excellent if the  injury is recognized and treated promptly. Erectile dysfunction following  treatment for high-flow priapism is rare.&nbsp;  Erectile function is preserved in 80-100% of patients following  embolization with autologous blood.92&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><u>Scrotal/Testicular Injury</u></strong><br>
      <strong>Mechanism </strong><br>
    Injury to the testis is commonly  associated with straddle injury.&nbsp; These  may include bicycle crossbar injuries, where the testis is forced against the  pubic ramus, causing tearing of the tunica albuginea.&nbsp; Injuries may also result from hits or kicks  to the scrotum during sporting events or roughhousing.&nbsp; Due to its higher position in the scrotum,  the right testis is more prone to injury compared to the left.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Injuries tend to be less common in infants  due to the smaller size and increased mobility of the testes during  infancy.&nbsp; Significant testicular injury  associated with minor trauma in these patients should raise the possibility of  intrinsic testicular pathology, including malignancy.<br>
  <strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trauma to the scrotum without  underlying testicular injury tends to resolve within a short time.&nbsp; In patients with pain that initially resolves  after a short period but recurs after several days, traumatic epididymitis  should be considered.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>&nbsp; However, pain persisting greater than 2 hours  after trauma is suspicious for more significant testicular injuries, including  testicular torsion or rupture.93&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Testicular torsion associated with  scrotal injury, while uncommon, has been reported.&nbsp; Cases of delayed testicular torsion following  blunt scrotal trauma, sports-related injuries, and bicycle riding have also  been reported.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a>&nbsp; A history of trauma is the presenting symptom  in 4-8% of all cases of testicular torsion.93,<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Acute scrotal swelling may also be associated  with intraperitoneal pathology, such as appendicitis, peritonitis, liver  laceration, or splenic rupture.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""> </a>&nbsp; In the child with a history of abdominal  trauma, scrotal pathology in the absence of scrotal trauma should prompt a  thorough evaluation.99&nbsp; In the  newborn period, adrenal hemorrhage should also be considered.&nbsp; Retroperitoneal imaging with ultrasonography  aids in differentiating this diagnosis from other etiologies of scrotal  swelling or ecchymosis.</p>
  <p><strong>Management</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If physical examination and imaging,  such as ultrasound, are indeterminate or suggest significant testicular injury,  early scrotal exploration is recommended. Rates of salvage in cases of  testicular rupture have been reported as high as 90% if performed within 72  hours.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Early exploration may also lead to decreased  convalescent times and reduced risk of infection.&nbsp; In cases of penetrating scrotal injury, a  careful physical exam should be performed to determine the depth of penetration  and to ensure adequate cleansing and debridement.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In cases of suspected torsion, early  exploration is also recommended. Testicular salvage rates for torsion appear to  increase with earlier exploration, with little benefit seen after 72 hours.92  In contrast, nonoperative management has been associated with orchiectomy rates  of approximately 45%.1&nbsp; Animal  studies suggest that early application of ice to the scrotum may aid in the  preservation of seminiferous tubules in testicular torsion.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases of isolated hematocele may be  followed non-operatively in the absence of impaired testicular flow.&nbsp; Isolated epididymitis may also be treated  with supportive care including scrotal elevation and nonsteroidal analgesics.&nbsp; In the absence of ischemic changes, testicular  fracture without disruption of the tunica albuginea may be observed.&nbsp; If nonoperative management is selected,  follow-up with both physical exam and ultrasonography should be used to monitor  resolution of injury.<br>
<strong>Complications</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infection following penetrating  injury may be minimized by adequate wash-out and broad-spectrum  antibiotics.&nbsp; Failure to surgically treat  a significant testis injury or torsion may result in a prolonged convalescent  period. </p>
  <p><strong><u>Vaginal Injuries</u></strong><br>
      <strong>Mechanisms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br>
    Vaginal injuries are relatively rare  in the pediatric population and are typically due to straddle injuries.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Straddle injuries may be associated with  falls from bicycles, monkey bars, tree limbs, or ladders.&nbsp; Injuries may also be due to foreign body  insertion or blunt trauma associated with motor vehicle collisions.&nbsp; Pelvic fractures may result in both  penetrating injury due to bone spicules and traction injury due to shear forces.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Due to the proximity of the urethra and  vagina and the susceptibility of the urethrovaginal septum to injury, traumatic  urethral injuries in girls should prompt an evaluation for associated vaginal  injuries.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prompt diagnosis is essential to  avoid fistulae, stenosis, or other long-term complications of unrecognized  vaginal injuries.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Physical exam may show evidence of labial  bruising, bleeding at the introitus, vulvar edema, or hematuria.&nbsp; Patients with pelvic fractures should also be  evaluated for urethral injury.102 Examination in the emergency room  can underestimate the extent of injuries.&nbsp;  Lighting may be inadequate and patients are often unable to fully  cooperate with a sensitive or uncomfortable exam, leading to an incomplete  examination.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Although an examination may be attempted with  oral or intravenous sedation in the emergency department, prior studies have  suggested a significant increase in the extent of injuries identified on exam  under anesthesia as compared to evaluation in the emergency department.108&nbsp; Based on these findings, exam under  anesthesia should be performed when any doubt exists as to the extent of the  injury.&nbsp; Relative indications for  evaluation under anesthesia include a young or uncooperative patient, inability  to see the full extent of the injury, vaginal hemorrhage, expanding hematoma,  or concomitant injuries which require examination under anesthesia.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a><br>
  <strong>Management</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operative management is seldom  required for genital trauma in young girls.103 However, sexual abuse  or assault may be identified in up to 25% of girls with genital injury.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a> &nbsp;Cystoscopy,  vaginoscopy, and rectal exam should be performed to fully evaluate associated  injuries.1 Continuous flow of vaginoscopy aids in complete  evaluation of the vagina, allowing for removal of foreign bodies and  coagulation of isolated mucosal bleeding.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a>&nbsp; Gentle coaptation of the introitus during  endoscopic examination with irrigation allows for better distention and  visualization of the vaginal vault.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more extensive vaginal  lacerations, primary repair should be performed if possible, to reduce the rate  of vaginal stenosis and urethrovaginal fistulae.105&nbsp;&nbsp; Vaginal lacerations may be repaired in  layers with absorbable sutures <strong>(Figure 6)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Figure 6b</strong>: Post-operative appearance  of injury after primary closure.</p>
  <p> Perioperative use of antibiotics may help reduce the risk of secondary  infection and wound dehiscence.&nbsp;  Postoperative care includes the avoidance of extremely lower extremity  abduction, stiz bathing, and the use of topical antibiotic ointments.&nbsp; For injuries that extend into the introitus,  the use of permanent monofilament sutures in an interrupted fashion is  recommended to reduce post-repair dehiscence risk.&nbsp; <br>
    <strong>Complications</strong><br>
    The most significant complication  following vaginal trauma is stricture, which can rarely follow severe  injury.&nbsp; Long-term follow-up is essential  to rule out postpubertal development of vaginal stenosis or hematocolpos,  especially in patients with extensive urethrovaginal injuries.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a><br>
    <strong>Associated Rectal Injuries</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although rectal injuries are  associated with increased morbidity in the adult population, they tend to be  rare and less severe in children.&nbsp; Prolonged  delay in diagnosis and presence of associated anorectal injury may increase  post-operative complication rates in children with traumatic genital  injuries.&nbsp; Complications in these  patients include wound infection, dehiscence, and fistulae.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> </a>&nbsp; To minimize these risks, patients with a  delayed diagnosis of genital injury with concomitant anorectal injury may  require temporary diverting colostomy.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""> </a></p>
  <p><strong><u>Conclusions</u></strong><br>
Pediatric  genitourinary trauma is uncommon and requires experienced subspecialists to  optimize care and minimize complications. Key principles of management include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Indications for imaging pediatric trauma patients include  penetrating injury, a history of significant mechanism of injury, the presence  of significant fractures or associated organ injury, and the presence of  hematuria &gt;50RBC/hpf.</li>
    <li>Abdominal and Pelvic CT scan with contrast is the most  sensitive modality for diagnosis and classification of pediatric genitourinary  injury.</li>
    <li>The majority of blunt renal injury can be managed  non-operatively. The major decision the urologist faces is when to surgically  intervene in cases of grade IV and V injury.</li>
    <li>A high index of suspicion is necessary to accurately and  promptly diagnose ureteral injury.</li>
    <li>A delayed diagnosis of UPJ disruption or ureteral injury  should be managed by nephrostomy drainage and delayed repair.</li>
    <li>The type of ureteral repair is dependent on the location and  extent of injury</li>
    <li>Indications for imaging the lower urinary tract include  penetrating injury, the presence of gross hematuria with concomitant pelvic fracture,  urinary retention or blood at the urethral meatus.</li>
    <li>The major determinant of bladder injury management is  extraperitoneal vs intraperitoneal injury.</li>
    <li>Traumatic lacerations are more likely to involve the bladder  neck and posterior urethra in children.</li>
    <li>The retrograde urethrogram is the most sensitive test for  assessing urethral injury.</li>
    <li>Acute management of urethral injury includes an assessment of  bladder neck competency and the establishment of continuous urinary drainage,  preferably via a urethral catheter.</li>
    <li>Posterior urethral disruption can be managed by immediate  primary repair or late repair with suprapubic drainage.&nbsp; The subsequent complications are related to  the severity of injury, not the management strategy.</li>
    <li>Neonatal penile trauma is most often iatrogenic from  circumcision injury</li>
    <li>Ultrasonography is a valuable adjunctive tool to physical  exam in evaluating scrotal trauma</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Examination  under anesthesia should be used to fully assess the extent of genital trauma<br>
