  <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Varicocele management was  historically recognized as an adult problem, observed in nearly 15% of the  adult male population (Saypol 1981).&nbsp;  Later, it was observed that men presenting for infertility work-up  showed a higher percentage of varicoceles&mdash;one-third of all men evaluated for  infertility, representing 15-20% of all men with varicoceles (Pryor and  Howards, 1987).&nbsp; When those varicoceles  were surgically corrected, resulting in improved sperm characteristics as well  as pregnancy rates, a causative relationship between varicocele and infertility  was suspected.&nbsp; With ongoing studies to  confirm, varicocelectomy has become standard practice for the adult male noted to  have a varicocele when seeking treatment in an infertility clinic.&nbsp; Since in the mid-1980s it has been accepted  that these varicoceles begin in adolescence and puberty, don&rsquo;t spontaneously  disappear, and, when operated on, can reverse testicular growth retardation  (Kass and Belman, 1987).&nbsp; However, given  the high prevalence in the adult male population (15%), and of those, only  15-20% seeking treatment in infertility clinics, the dilemma for the  practitioners who care for adolescent males is how to predict the future&mdash;who  will eventually have problems with infertility and therefore who might benefit  from varicocelectomy sooner rather than later in life, or not at all.&nbsp; This chapter will discuss more fully the  factors related to this dilemma so that each practitioner or student can better  understand how to personalize the care for each patient with a varicocele.<br>

  <p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A varicocele is an abnormal  enlargement of scrotal veins draining blood from the testis.&nbsp; A classification system is traditionally used  to describe the severity.&nbsp; A subclinical  varicocele, or Grade 0, is one not appreciated on physical exam but found  serendipitously on scrotal ultrasound.&nbsp;  Grade 1 varicoceles can not been seen, but are palpated on exam as  swelling in the scrotal veins observed only with Valsalva effort, hence,  enhancing retrograde venous flow.&nbsp; Grade  2 varicoceles are those veins which are palpably enlarged with no need for  Valsalva maneuvers, but cannot be visualized through the scrotal skin.&nbsp; Grade 3 varicocele refers to visualization of  the engorged veins through the scrotal skin with no manipulation nor additional  Valsalva pressure (Dubin &amp; Amelar, 1970; Figure 1).</p>
  <p><strong>Epidemiology</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Varicocele is highly prevalent in  adult male society; approximately 15% of men have one.&nbsp; The appearance of varicocele on physical exam  is largely a post-pubertal phenomenon, and the incidence of varicocele  increases with age.&nbsp; In a Danish study  published in 1971, on routine school physical of 188 boys aged 6-9 years old,  none showed varicocele (Oster 1971).&nbsp;  According to this study, as well as numerous others the incidence of  varicocele increases to 16% through the years of puberty (Horner, 1960; Steeno  et al, 1976; Yerokhin, 1979; Berger, 1980; D&rsquo;Ottavio et al, 1981).&nbsp; The reported incidence is dependent on the  researchers&rsquo; definition of varicocele&mdash;whether grade 1 was included or not&mdash;and  also on the mode of diagnosis, specifically, physical exam versus Doppler  ultrasound exam.&nbsp; When a combination of  physical exam with concurrent color Doppler ultrasound exam to determine  retrograde venous flow was used to examine German school boys in 1998-99, the  prevalence of varicocele on physical exam combined with color Doppler  ultrasound in adolescents aged 12-18 years was as high as 42.8% (Pfeiffer, 2006).&nbsp; These numbers are not representative of what  tertiary care centers in the United States are observing.&nbsp; To date, there are no clear definitions as to  minimal requirements of retrograde flow on Color Doppler ultrasonography, nor  number of dilated veins, to define varicocele.&nbsp;  [ASEEM&mdash;this is  where Harriet Paltiel&rsquo;s 4 ultrasound pictures would probably be best.]</p>
  <p>Most varicoceles  are found on the left side only&mdash;85-90% of the time.&nbsp; Generally, when a right-sided varicocele is  appreciated, it is only in association with a left-sided varicocele.&nbsp; Bilaterality is observed 10% of the  time.&nbsp; Rarely, a varicocele occurs  exclusively on the right side, which should prompt an ultrasound of the  retroperitoneum to rule out a mass lesion.&nbsp;  While ethnicity appears to affect testis size, it does not appear to  affect the frequency of varicocele.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prevalence of each grade of  varicocele for adolescents is difficult to truly understand.&nbsp; It was reported as 60% grade 1, 27% grade 2,  and 13% grade 3 (Niedziedlski, 1997), but detection of varicocele depends on  proper screening at physical exam or the patient complaining of a new finding  on self-exam.&nbsp; While many have suggested  that grade of varicocele is more commonly found in older patients, this does  not necessarily mean that varicocele grade worsens with age.&nbsp; When an individual patient is observed,  infrequently will his grade of varicocele change with time.</p>
  <p><strong>Anatomy</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The testis has three main sources of  blood supply:&nbsp; the testicular artery, the  artery of the vas deferens, and the cremasteric artery.&nbsp; Once within the testis, there is  communication of arterial blood.&nbsp; The  venous drainage, as in many areas of the body, is less predictable.&nbsp; A myriad of veins exist at the scrotal and  groin levels to drain the testis.&nbsp; The  most extensive network is known as the pampiniform plexus which begins adjacent  to the testis and extends into the groin with the spermatic cord (Wishahi,  1991).&nbsp; Part of the function of this  network of veins is to cool the neighboring arterial blood from a core body  temperature of 37&#730;C to the scrotal temperature of 33&#730;C by a counter-current  heat exchange process (Turner, 1982).&nbsp;  The existence of varicocele, in theory, causes pooling of blood and  therefore proves an ineffective cooling mechanism.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The distal most portion of the  pampiniform plexus is drained by the anterior scrotal vein into the femoral  vein.&nbsp; The four main sources of drainage,  however, are the testicular, vasal, cremasteric, and external pudendal veins.&nbsp; The vasal vein empties into the inferior vesical  vein and eventually the internal iliac vein.&nbsp;  More proximal drainage of the plexus is into the cremasteric veins,  which empty into the inferior epigastric vein and eventually the external iliac  vein.&nbsp; The main drainage of the  pampiniform plexus is the testicular vein, which drains directly into the left  renal vein on the left, and into the inferior vena cava on the right.&nbsp; The anatomic relationship on the left  requires a slightly longer vein, which has given rise to the reason for the  predominance of varicocele on the left. </p>
  <p><strong>Clinical  Presentation &amp; Diagnosis</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most often in adolescent males, a  varicocele is found on a routine sports or school physical exam by the health  practitioner who performs an informed genital exam.&nbsp; Sometimes a post-pubertal patient notes a new  scrotal mass or swelling, or complains of a dull, bothersome discomfort in the  scrotal region, especially after exercise or prolonged standing.&nbsp; Generally, the scrotal swelling associated  with varicocele is painless.&nbsp; The  clinical examination of any adolescent male&rsquo;s genitals should be performed  while the patient is standing, ideally in a warm room.&nbsp; Many varicoceles would be missed if the  patient is examined in the supine position because the dilated veins collapse.</p>
              
  <p>As  noted previously, Grade 3 varicocele will be obvious on visual inspection of  the scrotum as distensions of tissue, sometimes quite large, in the area of the  spermatic cord.&nbsp; In the absence of this,  the spermatic cord should be palpated above the level of the testis, where a  palpable varicocele (Grade 2) has been described as feeling like a bag of worms  or a series of squishy soft tubes.&nbsp; To  detect Grade 1 varicocele, with the spermatic cord between the practitioner&rsquo;s  thumb and forefingers, the patient should be asked to cough or to bear down to  produce a Valsalva effect.&nbsp; Grade 1  varicocele will produce a filling sensation between the practitioner&rsquo;s  fingers.&nbsp; The physical exam of the  spermatic cord should be completed with the patient in the supine position,  confirming that the dilated veins disappear (as a solid mass would not). </p>
  <p>If a varicocele  has been observed on physical exam, testicular size or volume should be  measured, looking for size discrepancy between the two sides.&nbsp; On palpation one can most effectively gauge  whether the right and left sides are grossly symmetric.&nbsp; A prepubertal testis should have a volume of  1-3 milliliters.&nbsp; A size of &gt;3 ml  indicates the initiation of puberty, and this enlargement generally begins  before any sign of pubic hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For adequate volume calculation,  however, a number of devices have been developed for office use such as the  Prader orchidometer, which is a string of ovoid-shaped beads of increasing  sizes, and the Rochester (Takihara) orchidometer, which is a ring filled with  small cards with open spaces punched out to accommodate the shape of a testis  (Figure 2).&nbsp; Some practitioners use  rulers, others use calipers.&nbsp; For many,  the most reliable method for volume calculation is scrotal ultrasound which has  been demonstrated to be a more reliable method than the orchidometers (Diamond,  2000).&nbsp;&nbsp; If using a two-dimensional  measuring system, the testis volume (in milliliters) is calculated by  multiplication of the width x length x depth (in centimeters) by a constant,  such as 0.71 as determined by Lambert, to avoid complicated calculus  formulas.&nbsp; The choice of Lambert&rsquo;s  formula was investigated by pediatric radiologists and determined to be the  most accurate (Paltiel, 2002).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultrasound has been demonstrated on  animal studies to have the best correlation with actual testis size (Paltiel,  2002).&nbsp; Ultrasound and Prader  orchidometer have a strong correlation, but the correlation was directly  related to the investigator&rsquo;s clinical experience (Behre, 1989).&nbsp; Another small study of adolescent boys (n=22)  compared use of the Prader orchidometer to ultrasound, and unfortunately 24% of  the boys with testicular hypotrophy would have been missed by their Prader  examination alone (Costabile, 1992).&nbsp; In  the same study, three patients were thought to have a size discrepancy of &gt;2  milliliters, but were found to be equivalent on ultrasound.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it is important to remember  that the adolescent testes do not grow at exactly the same rate.&nbsp; When boys with varicocele were followed with  yearly ultrasounds due to a 15% size discrepancy, the majority showed  resolution of their size discrepancy which was durable with time (Kolon  2008).&nbsp; For the adolescents in that  particular study, this meant that 51-71% were not recommended surgical  correction of their varicocele, which may have been suggested if one static  measurement had been taken.&nbsp; Hence, the  authors strongly recommend at least two sequential ultrasounds (ideally 6-12  months apart) documenting testes size before the decision is made to proceed  with surgery.<br>

  <p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As discussed previously, the  anatomic aspect of a varicocele is abnormal dilation of the veins draining the  testis, animal models of which have been created by partial ligation of the  left renal vein (Saypol, 1981).&nbsp; How this  dilation eventually results in testicular damage is still a point of academic  discussion.&nbsp; Several mechanisms have been  suggested:&nbsp; hyperthermia, hypoxia,  adrenal reflux, endocrine imbalances, testicular paracrine imbalances, and  altered blood flow.&nbsp; We will discuss  below the mechanisms that have substantial support.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hyperthermic effect has been  discussed previously in this chapter with the counter-current heat exchange  mechanism of the pampiniform plexus, which is disrupted with varicocele.&nbsp; The resultant hyperthermia affects DNA  polymerase activity in germ cells for DNA replication, as well as protein  synthesis in round spermatids, both of which are temperature sensitive with  optimal function at 33&#730;C and 34&#730;C, respectively (Fujisawa, 1988; Fujisawa,  1989).&nbsp; This inability for germ cells to  reproduce could then explain the reduced spermatogonia cells observed on testis  biopsy of young varicocele patients (Hienz, 1980).&nbsp; Sertoli cells are potentially affected by the  higher temperature as well (Sofikitis, 1992).</p>
  <p>The endocrine  imbalances are more complicated, with discrepancies between animal models and  humans between serum testosterone levels, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  challenge responses, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone  (FSH) levels (Skoog, 1997).&nbsp; Neither the  Leydig nor the Sertoli cells appear to function optimally in the testis  adversely affected by a varicocele (Rajfer, 1987).&nbsp; Intratesticular testosterone levels could  have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis, as could poor Sertoli cell  responsiveness to FSH stimulation, or their altered production of inhibin as  well as transferrin (Plymate 1992; Griswold, 1988).&nbsp; Furthermore, it is unclear whether these  endocrine effects are due to the presence or absence of the hormone, per se, or  a local dilutional effect in the increased venous volume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes in blood flow to the testis  may be a way to explain all of the other dysfunctions.&nbsp; Evidently, the blood pressure within the  testis is relatively low compared to other compartments of the body.&nbsp; With even slight increases in the  post-capillary pressures, the interstitial spaces can become flooded (Sweeney,  1991).&nbsp; In that environment, neither  Leydig nor Sertoli cells can function properly, which in turn affects the  health of the spermatogonia which are already adversely affected by the rise in  temperature.&nbsp; The difficulty in fully  accepting alterations in pressure due to altered blood flow as the causative  mechanism is the fact that bilateral deleterious effects have been observed,  despite the pressures in the right testis being unaffected when the left testis  pressures are high.&nbsp; Venograms clearly  demonstrate the communications between the two venous systems via the right  testicular vein in many patients with varicocele, hence something abnormal  could be delivered from the affected left side to the unaffected right side  (Narayan et al, 1981).&nbsp; Also, temperature  could explain the bilateral deleterious effects as the warmer left testis sits  in close proximity to the right testis, which is warmed slightly (Goldstein,  1989).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The endpoint of this pathophysiology  is poor testis growth.&nbsp; This is referred  to as hypotrophy.&nbsp; On testis biopsy, the  poor growth is seen in all cell types of the testis, but primarily with the  germ cells and Sertoli cells (Kass, 1987; Hienz, 1980).&nbsp; The Leydig cells&rsquo; appearance varies widely  from atrophy to hypertrophy (Hienz, 1980).&nbsp;  The eventual result, not surprisingly, is poor sperm production as  demonstrated on semen analysis in young men who have testicular hypotrophy with  concurrent varicocele (Haans, 1991).</p>
  <p><strong>Management</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a diagnosis of varicocele is  made on clinical exam, calculation of testis volumes is highly recommended with  scrotal ultrasound.&nbsp; If no size  discrepancy is noted, and the patient has no bothersome symptoms, it is  reasonable to follow with yearly physical exam and scrotal ultrasound to  monitor testis growth through puberty.&nbsp;  Once the patient completes puberty, semen analysis should be offered to  confirm appropriate sperm count and motility.&nbsp;  This recommendation is regardless of varicocele grade, as hypotrophy and  eventual semen parameters are not related to grade of varicocele, which has  been long established in the adult subfertile population (Dubin and Amelar,  1970).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While well established in the  infertile adult population that testicular hypotrophy adversely affects semen  parameters, only recently in the adolescent population have size differential  criteria been established to predict likely sperm dysfunction.&nbsp; Historically, a difference of 2-3 ml or more  was considered to represent significant testicular volume loss, and corrective  surgery would result in catch-up growth of 80% of those testes (Costabile,  1992).&nbsp; Others used a percentage of  volume differential as a cutoff for surgical intervention, ranging anywhere  from 10-25%.&nbsp; Data supported these  decisions in that &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; growth was appreciated in the hypotrophic testis  post-surgical correction.&nbsp; The eventual  of goal of fertility, however, was not known for adolescent boys.&nbsp; To investigate what percentage volume  difference between the two testes resulted in substantially different semen  parameters, 57 adolescent males who had reached Tanner stage 5 of pubertal  development and who were willing to provide a sperm sample for analysis were evaluated  (Diamond, 2007).&nbsp; Semen analysis  consisted of total sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm concentration.&nbsp; By comparing three volume differential  groups:&nbsp; &lt;10%, 10-20%, and &gt;20%,  the sperm concentration was significantly lower in the 10-20% and the &gt;20%  groups as compared to the &lt;10% group.&nbsp;  The percent sperm motility was significantly lower in the &gt;20%  differential group as compared to the &lt;10% and 10-20% groups.&nbsp; The total sperm motility was also  significantly lower in the &gt;20% differential group as compared to the  &lt;10% group.&nbsp; Overall, the authors  concluded that any adolescent male with &gt;10% volume differential between his  testicles is potentially at risk for having sperm motility problems, which  could potentially be a marker of which boys would be at future risk of  infertility and hence warrant close surveillance with serial semen analysis or  corrective surgery.&nbsp; These risks are  greater for volume differentials exceeding 20%.</p>
  <p><strong>Surgical  Approaches</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A variety of surgical techniques  have been described and studied in the management of varicocele.&nbsp; Conceptually, the surgical approaches can be  divided into those which disrupt venous drainage above versus below the  internal inguinal ring.&nbsp; The ultimate  goal of surgery is to eliminate the varicocele but also to minimize risk to the  patient of complications such as recurrence of varicocele, formation of  hydrocele or atrophy to the testis.&nbsp;  While some risk of recurrence and hydrocele exists for all surgical  approaches, no report of testis atrophy in a surgically na&iuml;ve patient exists in  the medical literature for an approach which divides the spermatic veins above  the level of the internal inguinal ring where one can more reliably avoid  damage to the vas deferens and deferential vessels (Figures 3, 4).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting with approaches below the  level of the internal inguinal ring, Ivanissevich described a repair similar to  the approach of a standard inguinal hernia repair.&nbsp; This involves a skin incision lateral to the  pubic symphysis, above the external inguinal ring.&nbsp; Dissection is carried down to define the  inguinal ligament, followed by opening the external inguinal ring and external  oblique fascia, and mobilizing the spermatic cord over a Penrose drain for  visualization of the dilated veins (Figure 5). Loupe magnification, as well as  patient positioning in reverse Trendelenburg, may sometimes help with  identification of the dilated veins.&nbsp;  Once the vas deferens is carefully isolated along with the ilioinguinal  nerve, the veins are carefully identified and divided.&nbsp; Ideally, the spermatic artery is preserved,  if it can be identified, sometimes with the help of warm saline, papaverine, or  a hand-held Doppler ultrasound.&nbsp; The  failure or recurrence (some say persistence) rate of varicocele for adolescents  for this approach is 16%.&nbsp; The most  common complication of any varicocele repair is the development of scrotal  hydrocele, and for this approach, hydrocele is reported 3-8.6% of the time  (Dubin and Amelar, 1977; Ross and Ruppman, 1993; Kass and Marcol, 1992).&nbsp; Presumably, the formation of a hydrocele is  due to ligation of the lymphatic channels in the cord.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subinguinal or inguinal  microscopic approach has become the approach of choice for the adult  infertility surgeon (Marmar and Kim, 1994; Goldstein et al, 1992) and has  gained ground amongst some pediatric urologists as well.&nbsp; The skin incision is made directly below the  external ring but the external ring is left intact.&nbsp; The spermatic cord is fully delivered, with  or without the testis, and supported in the surgical field utilizing a Penrose  drain.&nbsp; With microscopic magnification,  identification and preservation of the testicular artery as well as lymphatic  channels can be more easily achieved.&nbsp;  This has resulted in a low recurrence rate, around 2%, and the lowest  hydrocele rate of &lt;1%.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two well established  surgical approaches for control of the varicocele above the level of the  internal inguinal ring.&nbsp; The Palomo  procedure is an open surgical approach, but access is achieved more proximally  on the spermatic vessels than with the Ivanissevich approach.&nbsp; The skin incision is made a fingerbreadth  medial to the anterior superior iliac spine and a fingerbreadth above the  estimated position of the internal ring.&nbsp;  A muscle splitting approach is used to enter the retroperitoneal space,  where the spermatic vessels can be seen coursing along the posterior peritoneal  wall (Figures 6, 7).&nbsp; As the vas deferens  is entering the internal ring well below this exposure, the ligation of the  vessels can be performed easily in the slim adolescent boy without risk of  vassal injury.&nbsp; When efforts have been  made to preserve the artery, the failure rate has been reported to be 13.6%,  but when the artery and vein are ligated together, the failure rate is less  than 2%.&nbsp; Hydrocele formation occurs in  approximately 7% of these males (Szabo and Kessler, 1984; Reitelman et al,  1987).&nbsp; While taking the spermatic artery  appears intuitively dangerous to the eventual health of the testis, follow-up  studies of both artery-preserving and artery-dividing groups and the  compensatory growth is comparable. (Atassi, 1995)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laparoscopic varicolectomy is  similar to the Palomo procedure in that ligation of the spermatic vessels  occurs at the same level (Figure 8).&nbsp;  Advantages to laparoscopic surgery are the minimally invasive, small  incisions made for a camera port in the umbilicus and two additional 3-5 mm  ports for a clip applier and dissecting graspers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, laparoscopy offer optical  magnification for ease and speed of surgery, as well as a fast recovery for  most patients.&nbsp; The success rate has been  reported to be similar to the Palomo procedure, but some report even better  outcomes, with only 1% failure rate and no complications. (Poddoubny, 2000).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interventional radiologists have  also successfully corrected varicoceles, utilizing sclerotherapy or  embolization of spermatic veins, and by definition avoiding the arterial supply  and lymphatics.&nbsp; This can be performed on  adults under local anesthesia, which is clearly an advantage, but the failure  rate varies widely, from 5-20% (Clarke et al., 2001; Mazzoni et al., 2001), and  the hydrocele rate is higher than for other surgical approaches at about 14%  (Fette and Mayr, 2000).&nbsp; Given the high  likelihood of requiring general anesthesia for an adolescent, as well as the  relatively poor recurrence and complication rates, this approach has not  routinely been used for adolescent varicocele management.</p>
  <p>From one of the  authors&rsquo; experience in surgical correction of varicocele, the greatest success  has been found in a combined open surgical with sclerotherapy approach.&nbsp; Specifically, this is a Palomo skin incision  and vessel mobilization proximal to the internal inguinal ring.&nbsp; Loupe magnification is used.&nbsp; With hand-held Doppler, at least one artery  is identified and isolated.&nbsp; An attempt  is made to spare lymphatic drainage as much as possible.&nbsp; Then all veins are tied individually and  divided, save the largest.&nbsp; After  completion of the vein ligations, the assistant is instructed to gently squeeze  above the testis along the spermatic cord as there is injection into this large  vein 3% STS (sodium tetradecyl sulfate) (Lebed et al., 2008) via a 22 gauge  angiocatheter to sclerose any minor feeding veins.&nbsp; This has been performed with success on  around 30 patients, with the only complication over 3-4 years of follow-up  being an episode of epididymitis versus phlebitis.</p>
  <p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management of varicocele for the  adolescent patient can be challenging.&nbsp;  Helping families understand the relatively small statistical risk of infertility  for their child may seem useful, but what every individual wants to know is  whether he will be in the affected group or not.&nbsp; With the help of testicular sizing on  ultrasound, and the increasing use of semen analysis in assessing the  fully-developed adolescent, the practitioner has more tools for reassurance of  families and/or justification for a surgical correction.&nbsp; <br>
