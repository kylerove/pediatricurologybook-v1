  <p><strong><u>Wilms&rsquo; Tumor </u></strong><br>
    <strong>Introduction</strong><strong><u> </u></strong><br>
Max Wilms&rsquo; description of a solid kidney tumor of triphasic  pathology was first published in 1899.[<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Wilms, 1899 #373">1</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, the  pathological entity which would eventually come to be known as Wilms&rsquo; tumor  (WT) was a near-universally lethal disease, despite aggressive surgical and  chemotherapeutic interventions.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Luckily, however, the world of pediatric renal  tumors has dramatically changed since that time.&nbsp; Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, cooperative  multi-institutional and international trials such as the National Wilms&rsquo; Tumor  Study Group (NWTSG), the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group (COG), the United Kingdom  Children&rsquo;s Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG), and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Internationale  d&rsquo;Oncologie P&eacute;diatrique (SIOP), among others, began to coordinate the care and  study of children with renal tumors.&nbsp;  Currently, the overall five-year survival rates for WT are roughly 90  percent in the most recent trials of NWTS/COG and SIOP groups.[<a href="#_ENREF_2" title="Metzger, 2005 #516">2-4</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>Epidemiology</strong><br>
WT is the most common solid renal malignancy in children with an annual  incidence rate of approximately 7 to 10 cases per million for children younger  than 15 years; tumors occur in approximately 500 children per year in the United  States.[<a href="#_ENREF_5" title="Gurney, 1995 #560">5-8</a>]&nbsp; More than three-quarters of WT cases are  diagnosed before age 5 with median age at 3.5 years.&nbsp; WT is seen slightly more in females than  males. &nbsp;There are racial/ethnic  differences in the development of WT; for example, African-Americans are at a  slightly higher risk of developing WT, whereas Asian-Americans are found to  have a lower risk of WT compared with Caucasians.[<a href="#_ENREF_7" title="Breslow, 1993 #563">7</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_9" title="Breslow, 1994 #566">9</a>]&nbsp; Bilateral WT are diagnosed at an earlier age  than unilateral tumors, typically at a mean of 2.5 years.[<a href="#_ENREF_7" title="Breslow, 1993 #563">7</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_10" title="Blute, 1987 #539">10</a>] </p>
  <p>Multi-disciplinary management of WT has  revolutionized disease outcomes, although at an associated higher cost.&nbsp; This translates into worse outcomes in  developing countries, where factors such as an inability to afford chemotherapy  or proper follow-up may lessen survival rates.[<a href="#_ENREF_11" title="Abdallah, 2001 #572">11</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_12" title="Uba, 2007 #573">12</a>]&nbsp; The  total chemotherapy-related costs have been estimated at approximately USD 1,500  to 4,500 in a previous NWTSG report.[<a href="#_ENREF_13" title="Green, 1998 #567">13</a>]&nbsp;  Follow-up imaging costs have also been reported to be substantial.[<a href="#_ENREF_14" title="Carrico, 1997 #568">14</a>] Efforts to develop more cost-effective  protocols without sacrificing patient survival are under investigation.[<a href="#_ENREF_13" title="Green, 1998 #567">13</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_15" title="D'Angio, 1993 #569">15-17</a>]<br>

  <p><strong>Etiology/Biology</strong><br>
    <em>Histopathology</em><br>
The classic triphasic WT histologic pattern includes blastemal cells,  stromal cells, and epithelial cells.&nbsp;  Blastemal cells, frequently referred to as &ldquo;small round blue cells,&rdquo; are  undifferentiated cells characterized by a tightly packed pattern with  basophilia and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio.&nbsp; Stromal cells are most commonly observed as  immature smooth and skeletal muscle, osseous, adipose, or cartilaginous cells.  Epithelial cells frequently form tubular, glomerular, or papillary structures.[<a href="#_ENREF_18" title="Hartman, 2005 #1">18</a>]&nbsp; The diagnosis of WT is  complicated by the fact that there may only be one or two of the cell types  found instead of the classic triphasic appearance.[<a href="#_ENREF_19" title="Schmidt, 1995 #2">19</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Anaplasia,  defined as large nuclear diameter, hyperchromatism, and abnormal mitotic  figures,[<a href="#_ENREF_20" title="Beckwith, 1978 #5">20</a>] is defined as an unfavorable histologic (UH) feature; anaplasia has  an approximate 5% incidence across NWTS and SIOP.&nbsp; Since it was first described, anaplasia has  been consistently associated with a poor prognosis &ndash; specifically, with a significantly  higher rate of death and tumor recurrence.[<a href="#_ENREF_21" title="Breslow, 1985 #503">21-23</a>]&nbsp; Anaplasia is further categorized as a focal  or diffuse pattern, with the latter found to be associated with an even worse  prognosis[<a href="#_ENREF_22" title="Faria, 1996 #7">22</a>].&nbsp; In the absence of  anaplasia, other WT histology types are categorized as favorable histology  (FH).&nbsp; <br>
In  FH WT, differentiated epithelial-predominant cell type was found to be  associated with earlier stage but poor chemotherapy response; on the contrary,  diffuse blastemal pattern was highly aggressive with a good response to  chemotherapy.&nbsp; Whether the predominant  cell type plays an important role in FH WT prognosis with modern WT treatment  strategies has been disputed, with some data suggesting equivalent outcomes,[<a href="#_ENREF_24" title="Beckwith, 1996 #3">24</a>] while other reports suggest that epithelial- or  blastemal-predominant tumors may have a worse event-free survival rate.[<a href="#_ENREF_25" title="Graf, 2012 #604">25</a>]&nbsp; In anaplastic WT, blastemal cell predominance  has been identified to be an independent predictor for poor outcomes.[<a href="#_ENREF_26" title="Zuppan, 1988 #10">26</a>]&nbsp; <br>
Nephrogenic  rests (NR) are precursor lesions to WT that are found in more than a third of  resected WT.[<a href="#_ENREF_27" title="Beckwith, 1990 #580">27</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_28" title="Beckwith, 1993 #581">28</a>]&nbsp; Most NR does not progress into WT cells as  they are incidentally identified in around 1% of infant autopsy studies.[<a href="#_ENREF_29" title="Beckwith, 1998 #582">29</a>]&nbsp; Distinguishing between  hyperplastic NRs and WT can be challenging.[<a href="#_ENREF_29" title="Beckwith, 1998 #582">29</a>]&nbsp; WT can present with a  pseudocapsule composed of compressed atrophic renal tissue adjacent to normal  renal parenchyma.&nbsp; NR can be further categorized  into perilobar nephrogenic rests&nbsp;(PLNRs) and&nbsp;intralobar nephrogenic  rests&nbsp;(ILNRs).&nbsp; ILNRs are associated  with <em>WT1</em> related condition such as  aniridia, WAGR, and Deny-Drash syndrome.&nbsp;  PLNRs are seen in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome related to  the 11p15 locus. </p>
  <p>NRs tend to occur bilaterally.[<a href="#_ENREF_27" title="Beckwith, 1990 #580">27</a>] WT patients with NR, especially PLNRs, should  have frequent and regular surveillance of their contralateral kidney due to an  increased risk for metachronous tumor development.[<a href="#_ENREF_15" title="D'Angio, 1993 #569">15</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_30" title="Coppes, 1999 #583">30</a>]&nbsp; Diffuse  hyperplastic perilobar nephrogenic rests are associated with a higher risk of  developing WT and with an increased incidence of anaplasia.[<a href="#_ENREF_31" title="Perlman, 2006 #584">31</a>]</p>
  <p><em>Genetics</em><br>
Like other pediatric malignancies, the genetic components of WT  development are the subject of extensive research inquiry, including associated  syndromes.&nbsp; One of the first genetic  alterations associated with WT identified was <em>WT1</em>(located at 11p13) deletion in patients with WAGR syndrome - a  rare syndrome with features of WT, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and  mental retardation.[<a href="#_ENREF_32" title="Riccardi, 1978 #19">32</a>]&nbsp; <em>PAX6</em> gene (highly associated with aniridia) is adjacent to <em>WT1</em> gene; higher WT rates in aniridia  patients with deletion of both <em>WT1</em> and <em>PAX6</em> have been reported.[<a href="#_ENREF_33" title="Muto, 2002 #25">33</a>]  Interestingly, further research has revealed that <em>WT1</em> plays an essential role in differentiating genitourinary tissue[<a href="#_ENREF_34" title="Kreidberg, 1993 #20">34-36</a>].&nbsp; <br>
Unlike WAGR syndrome, which is commonly associated with <em>WT1</em> deletion, children with Denys-Drash  syndrome (male pseudohermaphroditism, renal mesangial sclerosis, and  nephroblastoma) have <em>WT1</em> missense  mutation.[<a href="#_ENREF_37" title="Coppes, 1993 #23">37</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_38" title="Huff, 1996 #26">38</a>]&nbsp; WAGR syndrome and Denys-Drash syndrome  patients were found to have higher risk of bilateral WT.[<a href="#_ENREF_39" title="Breslow, 2003 #556">39</a>]<br>
Beckwith-Wiedermann syndrome (BWS) constitutes features including macroglossia,  macrosomia, hypoglycemia, visceromegaly, omphalocele, and predisposition to  several tumors, most commonly WT.&nbsp;  Genetic mutations with BWS affect the <em>WT2</em> gene, located at the 11p15 region.[<a href="#_ENREF_40" title="Koufos, 1989 #27">40</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_41" title="Shuman, 2006 #28">41</a>]&nbsp; Imprinted genes expressing either maternally  or paternally inherited gene are found at the 11p15 locus and alterations to  those imprinted genes (such as loss of imprinting (LOI) of <em>IGF-2</em>) may be responsible for WT development in subsets of  patients.[<a href="#_ENREF_42" title="Ravenel, 2001 #29">42</a>]<br>
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is defined as loss of one of two copies  of a chromosomal region also plays an important role in WT tumorigenesis.&nbsp; Approximately 20% of WT patients have been  recently reported to have LOH at 16q,[<a href="#_ENREF_43" title="Maw, 1992 #30">43</a>]&nbsp; while LOH at chromosome 1p  occurs in 10% of children with WT.[<a href="#_ENREF_44" title="Grundy, 1995 #31">44</a>]&nbsp; Data from NWTS-5 suggested  that tumor-specific LOH at chromosome 16q and 1p are associated with  significantly worse outcomes, specifically with increased relapse and death.[<a href="#_ENREF_45" title="Grundy, 1994 #32">45</a>]&nbsp; By contrast, LOH at 11q has  been associated with diffuse anaplastic tumors, but is not independently  associated with worse outcomes unless the entire long arm of chromosome 11 is  lost.[<a href="#_ENREF_46" title="Wittmann, 2007 #33">46</a>]<br>
New techniques such as DNA microarray expression profiling and array  comparative genomic hybridization are being utilized more to investigate the  molecular genetics of WT.&nbsp; They provided  new perspectives on WT genetics by examining global gene expressions in  specific tumor types/histologies.[<a href="#_ENREF_47" title="Williams, 2011 #500">47</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_48" title="Huang, 2009 #499">48</a>] </p>
  <p>Other genes reported to be associated with WT  include: <em>WTX</em> (a tumor suppressor gene  on X chromosome) ,[<a href="#_ENREF_49" title="Rivera, 2007 #494">49</a>] <em>CTNNB1 </em>(&beta;-catenin  gene in WNT/&beta;-catenin signaling pathway associated with <em>WT1</em> and <em>WTX</em> in WT),[<a href="#_ENREF_50" title="Royer-Pokora, 2008 #495">50</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_51" title="Ruteshouser, 2008 #496">51</a>] <em>FWT1 </em>(located  at 17q12-q21) and&nbsp;<em>FWT2&nbsp;</em>(located  at 19q13.4).[<a href="#_ENREF_52" title="Rahman, 1996 #497">52</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_53" title="McDonald, 1998 #498">53</a>]</p>
  <p><em>Biomarkers</em><br>
In order to avoid the twin extremes of over-treatment with excessive  complications and under-treatment with compromised survival, prognostic  biomarkers that can achieve better risk stratification are actively sought  worldwide.&nbsp; Multiple biomarkers have been  reported to predict WT recurrence, including markers of genetic abnormalities,[<a href="#_ENREF_54" title="Ohshima, 2012 #607">54</a>]  chromosomal LOH,[<a href="#_ENREF_55" title="Grundy, 2005 #504">55</a>]  disordered apoptosis,[<a href="#_ENREF_56" title="Ghanem, 2001 #574">56</a>]  abnormal cell/nuclear proliferation,[<a href="#_ENREF_57" title="Ghanem, 2000 #608">57</a>]  anomalous growth factor production,[<a href="#_ENREF_58" title="Bielen, 2012 #609">58</a>] and  altered regulation of tumor suppressor genes and/or oncogenes.[<a href="#_ENREF_59" title="Franken, 2013 #606">59</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_60" title="Perlman, 2011 #506">60</a>] <br>
Loss of apoptosis in tumor cells is identified as one of the  important mechanisms in tumor progression.&nbsp;  Apoptosis-associated regulatory protein Bcl-2, Bax , and Bcl-X were  found to be related to WT progression.[<a href="#_ENREF_56" title="Ghanem, 2001 #574">56</a>]&nbsp; Survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, was  reported to be potentially associated with favorable outcome of WT with decreased  cytoplasmic survivin expression.[<a href="#_ENREF_61" title="Basta-Jovanovic, 2012 #575">61</a>]&nbsp; The tumor suppressor protein  p53 has been reported to occur more frequently in anaplastic WT and in more  advanced disease stages.[<a href="#_ENREF_62" title="Bardeesy, 1994 #576">62</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_63" title="Malkin, 1994 #577">63</a>]&nbsp; Interestingly, p53 expression has been  reported to be altered after chemotherapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_59" title="Franken, 2013 #606">59</a>] Tumor expression of B7-H1, a cell-surface glycoprotein of the B7  family of T-cell coregulatory molecules, is associated with an increased risk  of tumor recurrence and of treatment failure in patients with both favorable  histology and anaplastic tumors.[<a href="#_ENREF_64" title="Routh, 2008 #578">64</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_65" title="Routh, 2013 #579">65</a>]</p>

&nbsp;There are a number of  congenital anomalies and syndromes associated with development of WT (<strong><u>Table 1</u></strong>).&nbsp; These can be broadly categorized as  overgrowth and non-overgrowth syndromes.&nbsp;  Overgrowth syndromes include Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Perlman  syndrome, Sotos syndrome, and the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndromes.&nbsp; The most studied non-overgrowth syndromes are  WAGR syndrome and Deny-Drash syndrome.&nbsp;  Other reported syndromes that are associated with WT include Frasier  syndrome, familial WT syndrome, Mosaic variegated aneuploidy, Fanconi syndrome,  Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and Bloom&ndash;Torre&ndash;Machacek syndrome.</p>
  <p><em>Prognostic  Factors</em></p>
  <p>Current WT treatment strategies depend heavily on risk of tumor  progression and recurrence. &nbsp;Major  prognostic factors include tumor staging, histology, and biology markers.&nbsp; <br>
    Staging criteria are base upon anatomical extent of the tumor  without considering other factors such as histology or biological prognostic  markers.&nbsp; Higher stage tumor is associated  with worse prognosis.&nbsp; The most commonly  used staging systems are developed from COG and SIOP.&nbsp; Unilateral tumors are classified as stage I  to IV; bilateral tumors are classified as stage V.&nbsp; The major difference is that NWTS/COG stages  tumor before chemotherapy is administered and SIOP stages are determined after  initial chemotherapy.&nbsp; The details of  staging are addressed in detail below.&nbsp; <br>
    Tumor histology is perhaps the most critical factor affecting  prognosis.&nbsp; Anaplastic histology,  especially diffuse type anaplasia, forebodes poor prognosis. Studies suggested  the presence of anaplasia was associated with higher rate of recurrence,  metastasis, and death.[<a href="#_ENREF_21" title="Breslow, 1985 #503">21</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_26" title="Zuppan, 1988 #10">26</a>]&nbsp; NWTS/COG determines favorable or unfavorable  histology based on presence of anaplasia.&nbsp;  SIOP has three histologic classifications: low-risk (completely necrotic  or cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma); intermediate-risk  (epithelial, stromal, mixed, regressive, or focal anaplastic nephroblastoma);  and high risk (blastemal or diffuse anaplastic nephroblastoma).[<a href="#_ENREF_66" title="Vujanic, 2002 #585">66</a>]&nbsp; <br>
    Biological factors provide additional information to further  stratify the risk and depict prognosis for WT patients.&nbsp; In NWTS-5, LOH of either chromosome 16q or 1p  was found to have a significantly higher rate of relapse independent of tumor  stage or histology.[<a href="#_ENREF_45" title="Grundy, 1994 #32">45</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_55" title="Grundy, 2005 #504">55</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_67" title="Messahel, 2009 #505">67</a>]&nbsp; LOH of 11p15 was associated with more tumor  relapse in very low risk WT patients who were not treated with chemotherapy,  but rather were surgically excised and then observed.[<a href="#_ENREF_60" title="Perlman, 2011 #506">60</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Historically, other factors such as age were also heavily considered  in prognostic evaluation.&nbsp; Children less  than 24 months old were found to have lower relapse rate.[<a href="#_ENREF_68" title="Breslow, 1978 #501">68</a>]&nbsp; With the new advancement in  WT regimens, the role of age greatly diminished.[<a href="#_ENREF_21" title="Breslow, 1985 #503">21</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_69" title="Breslow, 1991 #587">69</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>Presentation</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The typical presentation of WT is a  palpable, firm, smooth, non-tender abdominal mass.&nbsp; Other symptoms include abdominal pain,  hematuria, fever, and hypertension.&nbsp;  Subcapsular hemorrhage can cause rapidly increasing in abdominal size,  anemia, hypertension, and fever.&nbsp; Tumor rupture  can present as an acute abdomen. Tumor extension to renal vein or IVC can lead  to varicocele, hepatomegaly, ascites, and congestive heart failure.[<a href="#_ENREF_70" title="Shamberger, 2001 #507">70</a>]&nbsp; Due to the fact that WT is  commonly associated with congenital syndromes, children should be assessed for  associated anomalies including aniridia, hemihypertrophy, or genitourinary  abnormalities.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em>Differential Diagnosis</em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The differential diagnosis of WT  includes neuroblastoma and other renal tumors.&nbsp;  Their histologic and other major characteristics are listed in <strong><u>Table 2</u></strong>.</p>

      <em>Workup</em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laboratory tests should include  complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, serum calcium,  urinalysis, and a coagulation panel.&nbsp;  Complete blood count can detect anemia. Serum creatinine and BUN can  help evaluate pre-interventional renal function.&nbsp; Liver function tests may be abnormal with  liver metastasis.&nbsp; Hypercalcemia can be  found in patients with rhabdoid tumor of the kidney or congenital mesoblastic  nephroma.[<a href="#_ENREF_71" title="Jayabose, 1988 #508">71</a>] Urinalysis may reveal proteinuria which can be seen in patients  with Denys-Drash syndrome.&nbsp; Acquired von  Willebrand's disease&nbsp;has been reported in around 8 percent of WT patients  at presentation, which is obviously significant for operative planning.[<a href="#_ENREF_72" title="Coppes, 1992 #509">72</a>]</p>
  <p>Abdominal  ultrasound is the first-line imaging study for children with an abdominal  mass.&nbsp; Doppler can be used to further  detect tumor extension to renal vein or inferior vena cava that occurs in 4  percent of WT patients.[<a href="#_ENREF_73" title="Ritchey, 1992 #510">73</a>]&nbsp; Once the mass has been  confirmed on US, CT scan should be ordered in order to provide more detailed  anatomy of the renal mass, contralateral kidney tumor evaluation, and  metastasis detection.&nbsp; In contrast to  earlier recommendations, thin-sliced helical CT is recommended rather than  routine surgical exploration of the contralateral kidney.[<a href="#_ENREF_74" title="Ritchey, 2005 #511">74</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_75" title="Ritchey, 1995 #512">75</a>]&nbsp; Controversy exists in the choice of imaging  study between chest CT and chest X-ray for lung metastasis.[<a href="#_ENREF_76" title="Meisel, 1999 #513">76</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_77" title="Owens, 2002 #514">77</a>]&nbsp; MRI is utilized when tumor infiltration of  renal vein or IVC detection is equivocal by ultrasound or when the patient  cannot tolerate CT contrast dyes.</p>
  <p><em>Staging </em></p>
  <p>Tumor staging and histology are the most potent  predictors of WT outcomes.&nbsp; The most  commonly used staging systems are developed by NWTS/COG and SIOP.&nbsp; Unilateral tumors are categorized as stage I  to IV and bilateral tumors at presentation are categorized as stage V.&nbsp; The central difference lies in the timing of  the staging.&nbsp; NWTS/COG system assigns  staging at primary surgery.&nbsp; The staging  system by SIOP is performed after pre-operative chemotherapy.&nbsp; The detailed staging criteria are listed in <strong><u>Table 3</u></strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Treatment</strong><br>
Unless a tumor is deemed to be unresectable, biopsy prior to  chemotherapy is not typically recommended due to risk of tumor spillage and  seeding &ndash; a biopsied tumor will typically be upstaged based on the violation of  the tumor capsule.&nbsp; This is  controversial, however, as some centers have adopted pre-chemotherapy biopsy to  reduce inappropriate treatment such as giving chemotherapy to benign conditions  or inadequate chemotherapy to non-WT.[<a href="#_ENREF_78" title="Hall, 2006 #11">78-80</a>]&nbsp; UKCCSG trials demonstrated no significant  difference of 5-year survival between immediate nephrectomy compared with  initial biopsy with chemotherapy and delayed nephrectomy.[<a href="#_ENREF_81" title="Mitchell, 2006 #14">81</a>]&nbsp; Open biopsy rather than percutaneous biopsy  is indicated in bilateral WT with poor chemotherapy response in order to  achieve accurate assessment of anaplasia.[<a href="#_ENREF_82" title="Shamberger, 2006 #549">82</a>] <br>
Radical nephrectomy with transperitoneal approach is the mainstay of  WT management.&nbsp; Proper surgical staging  along with tumor extent evaluation and abdominal cavity exploration are  essential for adjuvant therapy planning including chemotherapy and radiation  therapy.&nbsp; Sampling of suspicious nodes is  recommended for tumor staging as well.&nbsp;  Gentle handling of the tumor is mandatory throughout the entire process  to prevent tumor spillage; spillage is known to be a significant risk factor  for local tumor relapse and requires more aggressive adjuvant therapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_83" title="Shamberger, 1999 #519">83</a>]<br>
NWTS/COG and SIOP differ in terms of timing of surgical excision  relative to chemotherapy.&nbsp; The NWTS/COG  approach (pre-chemo surgical excision) provides accurate assessment of the  disease extent and tumor histology.&nbsp; It  also identifies patients with benign disease and thus avoids unnecessary  chemotherapy.&nbsp; By contrast, the SIOP  approach (post-chemo surgical excision) has the advantage that surgery is often  technically easier with reduced tumor size and lower tumor spillage rate after  initial chemotherapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_84" title="Fuchs, 2009 #515">84</a>]&nbsp; Currently both groups report an excellent  5-year overall survival rate of approximately 90%.[<a href="#_ENREF_2" title="Metzger, 2005 #516">2-4</a>]<br>

              Concerning  chemotherapy, the most significant recent advance has been the adoption of  dactinomycin and vincristine; these drugs dramatically improved WT patient  survival even in advanced disease.&nbsp;  NWTS/COG and SIOP conducted multiple randomized trials to adjust the  combination of regimen in order to further improve survival with lower  complication rates.&nbsp; The recommended NWTS/COG  treatment protocol is organized in <strong><u>Table  4</u></strong>.

  <p>Laparoscopic  nephrectomy techniques have a limited role in WT management due to the concern  for tumor spillage and inadequate tumor staging.&nbsp; Duarte described the initial experience of  laparoscopic nephrectomy on WT patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_88" title="Duarte, 2004 #520">88</a>]&nbsp; Since then, there have been  multiple reported series of laparoscopic nephrectomy for WT, typically  restricted to patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_89" title="Piche, 2012 #521">89</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_90" title="Javid, 2011 #522">90</a>]&nbsp; </p>
              
  <p>Historically,  nephron sparing surgery (NSS) was generally reserved for bilateral WT or  children with a solitary kidney in whom preservation of renal function was  mandatory.[<a href="#_ENREF_3" title="D'Angio, 1989 #517">3</a>]&nbsp;  Recently, this technique has garnered increasing attention from  investigators.&nbsp; Data on NSS in preserving  long-term renal function, cardiovascular function, and overall health provide  an insight of the potential wider applicability of NSS on selected WT.[<a href="#_ENREF_91" title="Miller, 2008 #6">91</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_92" title="Cozzi, 2005 #7">92</a>]&nbsp; The  AREN0534 trial of COG allows for NSS in children with bilateral WT, or for  unilateral WT in children with syndromes which predispose to renal failure or  bilateral WT.[<a href="#_ENREF_93" title="Breslow, 2000 #5">93</a>]&nbsp; Although  contemporary data on NSS seems quite promising,[<a href="#_ENREF_89" title="Piche, 2012 #521">89</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_94" title="Cost, 2012 #601">94-96</a>] data on NSS outcomes in children with WT remain  scarce.&nbsp; As practice patterns continue to  evolve, NSS will likely be primarily utilized mainly at high-volume referral  centers.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Bilateral WT </em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bilateral WT is found in roughly  5-7% of WT patients.[<a href="#_ENREF_10" title="Blute, 1987 #539">10</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_97" title="Coppes, 1989 #545">97</a>]&nbsp; The major challenge in these children is to  preserve renal function while adequately treating the tumors.&nbsp; Historically, bilateral WT was managed by  radical nephrectomy of the more involved side and NSS on the contralateral  kidney.&nbsp; However, these patients were  found to have a significant risk of ESRD due to tumor recurrence and subsequent  nephrectomy.[<a href="#_ENREF_98" title="Ritchey, 1996 #546">98</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_99" title="Breslow, 2005 #547">99</a>]  Modern management of bilateral WT incorporates neoadjuvant chemotherapy along  with NSS as first-line treatment.[<a href="#_ENREF_100" title="Ritchey, 1995 #550">100-102</a>] The  most current COG protocol (AREN0534, as noted above) recommends 6 weeks of  vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin, followed by re-evaluation.&nbsp; Depending on tumor response, the patient then  receives either an attempt at NSS or an additional 6 weeks of chemotherapy.  Following surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimen depend  on tumor histology and staging.&nbsp; Open  bilateral biopsy may be considered if the tumor has a poor response to adjuvant  chemotherapy; poor chemotherapy response has been reported to be due to tumor  differentiation, which has a good prognosis if completely resected.[<a href="#_ENREF_82" title="Shamberger, 2006 #549">82</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_103" title="Weirich, 2001 #548">103</a>] </p>
  <p>Of note, true tumor enucleation is generally  reserved for large, centrally located tumors due to the concern for positive  margin.&nbsp; Anaplasia with positive margin  will require additional resection to avoid worse survival.[<a href="#_ENREF_102" title="Horwitz, 1996 #552">102</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_104" title="Cozzi, 1996 #553">104-106</a>]</p>
  <p><em>Late  Effects of WT Treatments</em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WT survivors may suffer from  long-term complications depending on the therapy regimen.[<a href="#_ENREF_107" title="Termuhlen, 2011 #523">107</a>] The  major reported sequelae include development of a second malignancy,  cardiotoxicity, renal impairment, musculoskeletal problems, and reproductive  issues. Patient who received more aggressive chemotherapy and radiation therapy  are obviously at higher risk.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second malignancy is one of the  concerning late effects from WT therapy.&nbsp;  WT survivors have been reported to have a 1% cumulative incidence at 10  years post-diagnosis and increasing incidence developing second tumor  thereafter.[<a href="#_ENREF_108" title="Li, 1983 #524">108-110</a>]  Radiation therapy is associated with a significantly higher risk of late tumor;  most second tumors have been reported to occur within the radiation field.[<a href="#_ENREF_109" title="Taylor, 2008 #525">109</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_110" title="Breslow, 1988 #526">110</a>]  Additionally, doxorubicin may potentiate this radiation effect.[<a href="#_ENREF_111" title="Breslow, 1995 #527">111</a>]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cardiotoxicity is a well-established  late effect of doxorubicin, specifically myocardial dysfunction and reduced  contractility.&nbsp; Common manifestations  include congestive heart failure and increased left ventricular afterload.[<a href="#_ENREF_112" title="Green, 2001 #528">112</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_113" title="Sorensen, 1995 #529">113</a>] The  risk of cardiac dysfunction is closely related to the total cumulative dose of  doxorubicin.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renal impairment in WT survivors can  be caused by loss of renal parenchyma from surgery or from nephrotoxicity  related to chemotherapy and radiation.&nbsp;  Severe renal dysfunction is usually associated with bilateral WT involvement  especially if they receive radiation therapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_98" title="Ritchey, 1996 #546">98</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_114" title="Lange, 2011 #530">114</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_115" title="Montgomery, 1991 #532">115</a>] Other  significant risk factors for late renal impairment include Denys-Drash and WAGR  syndromes in addition to radiation nephritis. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Musculoskeletal problems such as  scoliosis and short stature were found to be associated with radiation  treatment.[<a href="#_ENREF_116" title="Evans, 1991 #533">116-118</a>]  Females who received high-dose abdominal radiation therapy are at risk of  abnormal ovary development, higher incidence of infertility, spontaneous  miscarriages, premature birth and intrauterine growth retardation of offspring.[<a href="#_ENREF_119" title="Green, 2002 #536">119-121</a>]</p>
  <p><strong>Prognosis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall five-year survival rate of  WT patient has dramatically improved to greater than 90% at present.[<a href="#_ENREF_2" title="Metzger, 2005 #516">2-4</a>] Event-free  survival (EFS) rates rely heavily upon prognostic factors like tumor staging,  histology, biologic markers, and to a lesser extent, age at diagnosis and tumor  weight.&nbsp; </p>
              
  <p>In  the past, only 30% of WT patients survived with tumor recurrence.&nbsp; With salvage therapy, the five-year survival  rate of patient who have recurrence improves to 50-60% [<a href="#_ENREF_122" title="Abu-Ghosh, 2002 #588">122</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_123" title="Dome, 2002 #589">123</a>].&nbsp; Lung is  the most common site for recurrence.&nbsp;  Prognostic factors that are associated with favorable prognosis include  favorable histology, lower tumor stage, lower number of pulmonary nodules, no  prior radiotherapy, recurrence beyond 6-12 months after initial diagnosis, only  dactinomycin and vincristine as initial treatment, and complete resection of  original tumor.[<a href="#_ENREF_2" title="Metzger, 2005 #516">2</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_123" title="Dome, 2002 #589">123</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_124" title="Grundy, 1989 #592">124</a>] The ideal salvage therapy strategy remains  under investigation.[<a href="#_ENREF_122" title="Abu-Ghosh, 2002 #588">122</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_125" title="Saylors, 1998 #593">125-129</a>]</p>
  <p><strong><u>Non-Wilms&rsquo; Pediatric Renal Tumors </u></strong><br>
    <em>Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma</em><br>
    <strong></strong>Congenital  Mesoblastic Nephroma<strong></strong>(CMN) is the most common renal tumor in infants within the  first several months of life, with 90% diagnosed within the first year of life.[<a href="#_ENREF_130" title="Glick, 2004 #261">130</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_131" title="van den Heuvel-Eibrink, 2008 #258">131</a>]&nbsp; In one large series, the median age at  diagnosis was reported to be 19 days.[<a href="#_ENREF_132" title="Furtwaengler, 2006 #262">132</a>]&nbsp; Beyond three years of age, CMN is rarely  encountered.[<a href="#_ENREF_130" title="Glick, 2004 #261">130-136</a>]&nbsp; CMN has been noted to be more common in  males, with a roughly 2:1 male to female ratio.&nbsp;  CMN is thought to originate from the nephrogenic mesenchyme, with two  distinct histologic subtypes: the classic and cellular varieties.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classic CMN typically presents with  a lower tumor stage, smaller tumor volume, and at a younger age than cellular  CMN.[<a href="#_ENREF_132" title="Furtwaengler, 2006 #262">132</a>]&nbsp; Classic CMN was initially described in 1967  and noted to be composed of locally-infiltrative fascicles of spindle  cells.&nbsp; Vascular invasion at the tumor  periphery has been reported.[<a href="#_ENREF_137" title="Bolande, 1967 #265">137</a>]&nbsp; By contrast, cellular CMN is  hypercellular, with sheets of closely-packed spindle cells.[<a href="#_ENREF_138" title="Joshi, 1986 #266">138</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_139" title="O'Malley, 1996 #198">139</a>]&nbsp; Both types may coexist in a mixed pattern as  well.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Recent studies have shown that the classic and  cellular variants have differing genetic features.&nbsp; In the cellular variant, a t(12;15)(p13;q25)  translocation has been shown to produce a <em>ETV6-NTRK</em> gene fusion product which over activates tyrosine kinase signaling; this  translocation has not been demonstrated in classic CMN, however.[<a href="#_ENREF_140" title="Argani, 2000 #107">140</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_141" title="Knezevich, 1998 #267">141</a>]&nbsp;  Interestingly, this same translocation is found in infantile  fibrosarcoma, leading many authors to conclude that cellular CMN is in fact the  renal manifestation of that disease process.[<a href="#_ENREF_140" title="Argani, 2000 #107">140</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_141" title="Knezevich, 1998 #267">141</a>]<br>
    Prognosis for CMN is generally excellent, particularly in comparison  to other renal tumors.[<a href="#_ENREF_131" title="van den Heuvel-Eibrink, 2008 #258">131</a>]&nbsp; Most patients can be successfully treated  with radical nephrectomy alone; attempts to preserve renal parenchyma in these  patients through the use of partial nephrectomy are often unsuccessful, perhaps  due to the tumors&rsquo; locally invasive nature.[<a href="#_ENREF_132" title="Furtwaengler, 2006 #262">132</a>]&nbsp; For patients with Stage III tumors,  particularly older infants with the cellular variant, some authors have  suggested the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_132" title="Furtwaengler, 2006 #262">132</a>]&nbsp; Given the relative chemosensitivity of  infantile fibrosarcoma, this approach would seem logical in high-risk patients.[<a href="#_ENREF_142" title="Kurkchubasche, 2000 #269">142</a>]&nbsp;  </p>
  <p><em>Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney</em><br>
Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney (CCSK) is one of the more common  &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; renal tumors of childhood, representing 3% of pediatric renal  tumors in the United States.[<a href="#_ENREF_143" title="Argani, 2000 #108">143</a>]&nbsp; CCSK is typically described as a large,  homogenous, and often multi-cystic mass arising from the renal medulla;  necrosis and hemorrhage are common.&nbsp;  Histologically, these tumors are classically defined by cords of oval or  spindle-shaped cells separated by regularly spaced fibrovascular septa.[<a href="#_ENREF_20" title="Beckwith, 1978 #5">20</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_143" title="Argani, 2000 #108">143</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_144" title="Morgan, 1978 #109">144</a>]&nbsp; CCSK typically presents between the ages of  two and three years of life (range 2 months to 14 years) with a 2:1 male to  female ratio.&nbsp; No cases of bilateral CCSK  have been reported.[<a href="#_ENREF_131" title="van den Heuvel-Eibrink, 2008 #258">131</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_143" title="Argani, 2000 #108">143</a>]&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Perhaps the most notable feature of CCSK is its  propensity to metastasize to bone.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Among 351 tumors from the NWTSG, 4% of CCSK tumors presented with  metastatic lesions; after lymph node involvement (20%), bone lesions were the  most common metastatic site at presentation (1.4%), followed by lung and liver  (1.1% each).&nbsp; Importantly, bone was the  most common site of tumor recurrence (14%), followed by lung (11%) and abdomen  (7%).[<a href="#_ENREF_143" title="Argani, 2000 #108">143</a>]&nbsp; CCSK  recurrences commonly occur years after the initial diagnosis; interestingly,  this phenomenon is heightened among patients receiving doxorubicin, despite a  reduced overall recurrence rate in patients receiving this drug.[<a href="#_ENREF_143" title="Argani, 2000 #108">143</a>]&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Overall survival among children with CCSK is reduced as compared to  other renal tumors.&nbsp; Eight-year overall  survival has been reported to be as high as 83% among children 1 to 3 years of  age; however, this figure is reduced among both infants and children older than  4 years of age.[<a href="#_ENREF_131" title="van den Heuvel-Eibrink, 2008 #258">131</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_143" title="Argani, 2000 #108">143</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_145" title="Seibel, 2004 #238">145</a>]&nbsp; Other negative prognostic factors include  increased tumor stage and the presence of histologic tumor necrosis.&nbsp; Therapy with doxorubicin is perhaps the most  important modifiable risk factor for tumor recurrence, as its use reduced the  risk of relapse by 68% in the largest series reported to date.[<a href="#_ENREF_143" title="Argani, 2000 #108">143</a>]</p>
  <p><em>Rhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney</em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney (RTK)  is a rare but lethal pediatric renal tumor, comprising less than 2% of all  renal tumors in the combined European and US data.[<a href="#_ENREF_131" title="van den Heuvel-Eibrink, 2008 #258">131</a>]&nbsp; Initially described as a sarcomatoid variant  of WT, RTK was subsequently recognized as a distinct pathologic entity.[<a href="#_ENREF_20" title="Beckwith, 1978 #5">20</a>]&nbsp; RTK is characterized  histologically by the presence of monomorphic cells with vesicular nuclei and  prominent nucleoli.&nbsp; Immunohistochemical  staining commonly shows perinuclear vimentin staining,[<a href="#_ENREF_146" title="Weeks, 1989 #147">146</a>] as  well as complete lack of expression of the tumor suppressor gene product INI1.[<a href="#_ENREF_147" title="Hoot, 2004 #394">147</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    RTK commonly presents with hematuria and metastatic disease.[<a href="#_ENREF_131" title="van den Heuvel-Eibrink, 2008 #258">131</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_148" title="Tomlinson, 2005 #99">148</a>]&nbsp; Median age was 11 months (range 1 month to 5  years) with a slight male predominance (male to female ratio 1.4:1).&nbsp; In a combined analysis of data from both  NWTSG and European trials, 29% of infants with RTK presented with metastatic  disease, far more than other tumor types.[<a href="#_ENREF_131" title="van den Heuvel-Eibrink, 2008 #258">131</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Importantly, RTK has been noted to have a  predilection for concurrent central nervous system involvement, which may be  either metastatic RTK or synchronous primary CNS malignancies.[<a href="#_ENREF_148" title="Tomlinson, 2005 #99">148</a>]&nbsp; Among RTK patients with metastatic disease at  presentation, the most common metastatic sites were lung (83%), brain (73%),  liver (7%), and bone (5%).[<a href="#_ENREF_131" title="van den Heuvel-Eibrink, 2008 #258">131</a>]Overall survival among patients with RTK in the NWTSG trials was  23%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Survival has been shown to be  decreased with higher stage tumors (42% vs. 16% 4-year survival), presence of  CNS tumors (universal mortality in NWTS 1-5), and decreased patient age (41%  4-year survival above age 2 years vs. 9% survival below age 6 months).&nbsp; By contrast, patient gender, chemotherapy  regimen, and the use of radiotherapy have not been associated with survival.[<a href="#_ENREF_148" title="Tomlinson, 2005 #99">148-150</a>]&nbsp; Recently, cases of long-term survival after  autologous stem cell transplant have been reported.[<a href="#_ENREF_151" title="Koga, 2009 #256">151</a>]&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em>Renal Cell Carcinoma/Translocation Renal Cell Carcinomas</em><br>
Although WT is the most common primary renal neoplasm during the  first decade of life, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is more common during the  second decade of life and beyond.[<a href="#_ENREF_152" title="Grabowski, 2009 #333">152</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_153" title="Hartman, 1982 #323">153</a>]&nbsp; RCC constitutes 2-6% of pediatric renal  tumors overall,[<a href="#_ENREF_154" title="Chow, 1999 #318">154-156</a>] and  with a roughly 2:1 female to male ratio is more common among girls.[<a href="#_ENREF_157" title="Carcao, 1998 #324">157-160</a>]&nbsp; Pediatric RCC has recently been shown to  significantly differ from adult RCC, in terms of both tumor biology and  clinical behavior.[<a href="#_ENREF_157" title="Carcao, 1998 #324">157</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_161" title="Geller, 2004 #291">161-163</a>]<br>
&nbsp; In particular, pediatric RCC has been characterized by its unique  genetic features, specifically by chromosome Xp11 or t(6;11) translocation and  lack of chromosome 3p mutations.&nbsp; This  insight has led to the coining of the terms &ldquo;translocation RCC&rdquo; or  &ldquo;translocation carcinoma of the kidney&rdquo;, now recognized as a distinct  pathologic subtype under the 2004 WHO classification.[<a href="#_ENREF_164" title="Argani, 2001 #102">164-166</a>]&nbsp; Xp11.2 is the locus of the <em>TFE3</em> gene, a member of the  microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF) family; at least 6  specific <em>TFE3</em>-related cytogenetic  translocations and gene fusion products have been reported, with the most  common being <em>ASPL-TFE3</em> (t(X;17)(p11.2;q25))  and <em>PRCC-TFE3</em> (t(X;1)(p11.2;q21)).[<a href="#_ENREF_167" title="Argani, 2001 #101">167-169</a>]&nbsp; A second member of the MiTF family, <em>TFEB</em>, is also associated with a subset  of pediatric RCC, characterized by the <em>Alpha-TFEB</em> gene fusion product and a t(6;11)(p21;q12) translocation.[<a href="#_ENREF_164" title="Argani, 2001 #102">164</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_170" title="Argani, 2005 #345">170</a>]&nbsp;Histologically, Xp11.2 translocation RCC most commonly exhibits  papillary or pseudopapillary architecture with or without psammoma bodies and  clear cells with copious cytoplasm.[<a href="#_ENREF_160" title="Geller, 2008 #354">160</a>]  t(6;11) translocation RCC is morphologically similar, but tends to stain  positive for HMB-45, while Xp11.2 translocation RCC typically does not.[<a href="#_ENREF_164" title="Argani, 2001 #102">164</a>]&nbsp; Importantly, the development of translocation  RCC has been recently reported to be associated with a history of exposure to  cytotoxic chemotherapy, particularly topoisomerase II inhibitors or alkylating  agents such as cyclophosphamide.[<a href="#_ENREF_166" title="Argani, 2006 #356">166</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_171" title="Hedgepeth, 2009 #421">171</a>]&nbsp; The mechanism behind this association is at  present unclear.<br>
Just as translocation RCC can also occur in adults, so too can  non-translocation RCC occur in the pediatric age range;[<a href="#_ENREF_168" title="Argani, 2007 #358">168</a>]  however, the average age of non-translocation RCC patients is between 60 and 65  years.[<a href="#_ENREF_172" title="Leibovich, 2010 #437">172</a>]&nbsp; Although non-translocation  RCC may develop spontaneously even in young patients, multiple familial  syndromes predispose to the development of RCC at young ages.&nbsp; In particular, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome,[<a href="#_ENREF_173" title="Poston, 1995 #434">173</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_174" title="Walther, 1995 #435">174</a>]  tuberous sclerosis,[<a href="#_ENREF_175" title="Al-Saleem, 1998 #426">175</a>]  Birt-Hogg-Dube,[<a href="#_ENREF_176" title="Pavlovich, 2005 #438">176</a>] hereditary papillary renal carcinoma,[<a href="#_ENREF_177" title="Zbar, 1994 #436">177</a>] and hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma[<a href="#_ENREF_178" title="Launonen, 2001 #439">178</a>] have  been reported to be associated with the development of RCC among children and  adolescents.[<a href="#_ENREF_175" title="Al-Saleem, 1998 #426">175</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_179" title="Alrashdi, 2010 #430">179</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_180" title="Parast, 2004 #425">180</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
In addition to genetic and etiologic differences, pediatric RCC  differs from adult RCC in terms of clinical behavior.&nbsp; While adult RCC patients with lymph node  involvement tend to fare poorly, pediatric RCC patients with lymph node  involvement have a surprisingly good prognosis.[<a href="#_ENREF_160" title="Geller, 2008 #354">160</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_161" title="Geller, 2004 #291">161</a>]&nbsp; Importantly, these tumors have been reported  to occur more commonly than expected among children who have experienced prior  chemotherapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_159" title="Estrada, 2005 #361">159</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_166" title="Argani, 2006 #356">166</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_181" title="Lazarus, 2009 #360">181</a>]&nbsp; Depending on tumor characteristics (in  particular tumor size), some authors have noted that some pediatric RCCs may be  suitable for treatment with partial nephrectomy;[<a href="#_ENREF_158" title="Cook, 2006 #33">158</a>] the role of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in these patients  has been debated as well.[<a href="#_ENREF_182" title="Geller, 2009 #298">182</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_183" title="Indolfi, 2008 #362">183</a>]&nbsp; Regardless of treatment strategy, the  prognosis for RCC has been shown to be somewhat better than for other pediatric  renal tumors, with five-year survival rates of 72-87%.[<a href="#_ENREF_155" title="Pastore, 2006 #329">155</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_161" title="Geller, 2004 #291">161</a>]&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em>Renal Medullary Carcinoma</em><br>
Renal Medullary Carcinoma (RMC) is a rare and extremely aggressive primary  renal tumor which has been reported to occur almost exclusively in African-American  adolescents and young adults with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease;  indeed, RMC has been labeled as the &ldquo;seventh nephropathy&rdquo; of sickle cell  disease.[<a href="#_ENREF_184" title="Davis, 1995 #327">184</a>]&nbsp; RMC was originally described  in 1995, with fewer than 100 cases of RMC described since then.[<a href="#_ENREF_184" title="Davis, 1995 #327">184</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_185" title="Strouse, 2005 #364">185</a>]&nbsp; The reported mean age of RMC patients is 21  years, ranging from 5 to 39 years, with a 2:1 male to female ratio.[<a href="#_ENREF_186" title="Dimashkieh, 2003 #365">186</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_187" title="Swartz, 2002 #231">187</a>]&nbsp; <br>
As their name implies, RMC tumors arise centrally within the kidney,  perhaps from the transitional epithelium of the renal calyces; RMC is generally  believed to be a variant of collecting duct RCC.[<a href="#_ENREF_188" title="Yang, 2004 #367">188</a>]&nbsp; Tumor growth patterns is often reticular,  though a variety of growth patterns have been described.[<a href="#_ENREF_189" title="Cheng, 2008 #368">189</a>]&nbsp; Microscopically, RMC is  characterized by large nuclei with prominent vesicles and nucleoli as well as  intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm; the tumors are often accompanied by an  intense inflammatory response.[<a href="#_ENREF_184" title="Davis, 1995 #327">184</a>]&nbsp; Cytologically, RMC appears  similar to other high-grade carcinomas.[<a href="#_ENREF_190" title="Assad, 2005 #369">190</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to RTK, RMC  specimens have also been shown to have complete loss of INI1 expression.[<a href="#_ENREF_189" title="Cheng, 2008 #368">189</a>]&nbsp; </p>
  <p>RMC often presents  with gross hematuria and abdominal or flank pain, reflecting its propensity to  invade the renal sinus and/or pelvis as well as other local structures.&nbsp; Of 61 patients reported in the two largest  case series, all presented at tumor Stage III or IV.[<a href="#_ENREF_184" title="Davis, 1995 #327">184</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_187" title="Swartz, 2002 #231">187</a>]&nbsp; Despite  a wide variety of attempted therapies,[<a href="#_ENREF_185" title="Strouse, 2005 #364">185</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_191" title="Warren, 1999 #370">191</a>] the prognosis of RMC patients is dismal.&nbsp; With the exception of a single patient who  was alive at 2 years&rsquo; follow-up (and whose tumor was discovered at 1.8 cm in  size),[<a href="#_ENREF_192" title="Selby, 2000 #371">192</a>] the longest reported survival of any RMC  patient is 17 months.[<a href="#_ENREF_193" title="Coogan, 1998 #372">193</a>] </p>
  <p><em>Renal Angiomyolipoma</em><br>
Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is a generally benign neoplasm of the  kidney consisting of a varying proportion of dysplastic blood vessels, smooth  muscle, and adipose tissue.[<a href="#_ENREF_194" title="L'Hostis, 1999 #477">194</a>]&nbsp; These tumors are found much  more frequently in women than men (female to male ratio 4:1) at a mean age of  48 years (range 1-86).&nbsp; Though  classically associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS), 80% of AML occur  spontaneously.[<a href="#_ENREF_195" title="Nelson, 2002 #478">195</a>]&nbsp; Among TS patients, however,  up to 70% may develop AML, and up to 10% will have renal complications due to  their AML.[<a href="#_ENREF_196" title="Ewalt, 1998 #480">196</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_197" title="O'Callaghan, 2004 #468">197</a>]&nbsp; AML in TS patients tend to develop at a young  age, often during infancy; once present, AML is likely to grow over time.&nbsp; This has prompted some authors to recommend  annual renal ultrasound screening of TS patients.[<a href="#_ENREF_196" title="Ewalt, 1998 #480">196</a>]&nbsp; </p>
  <p>AML is typically a solid tumor, though cystic  variants have been described.[<a href="#_ENREF_198" title="Fine, 2006 #431">198</a>]&nbsp; The  triphasic components of AML are classically present in roughly equal  proportions, although any one can be predominant in individual tumors.[<a href="#_ENREF_194" title="L'Hostis, 1999 #477">194</a>]&nbsp; On  imaging studies, fat-poor AML in particular can be quite difficult to  differentiate from RCC or other renal tumors.[<a href="#_ENREF_199" title="Kutikov, 2006 #473">199</a>]&nbsp; AML is  generally located at the renal poles, may be bilateral or multifocal, and may  extend into the perirenal fat.&nbsp; Classic  AML is most often cytologically bland, although the smooth muscle component may  assume an atypical appearance with hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent  nucleoli.[<a href="#_ENREF_194" title="L'Hostis, 1999 #477">194</a>]&nbsp;  Recently, a rare malignant AML variant known as epithelioid AML has been  reported, with the possibility of widespread tumor metastasis.[<a href="#_ENREF_200" title="Faraji, 2009 #481">200</a>]<br>
  Although AML may be incidentally discovered on imaging studies, 60%  of patients present symptomatically, most commonly with flank pain, a palpable  mass, or hematuria.[<a href="#_ENREF_195" title="Nelson, 2002 #478">195</a>] &nbsp;In 15% of patients, AML  presents with retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome), which can be  life-threatening.[<a href="#_ENREF_195" title="Nelson, 2002 #478">195</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_201" title="Oesterling, 1986 #479">201</a>]&nbsp; Previous studies have shown that tumor size  of 4 cm or greater is the most significant predictor of tumor rupture; it is  therefore recommended that asymptomatic AML larger than 4 cm be treated in  order to prevent their rupture.[<a href="#_ENREF_201" title="Oesterling, 1986 #479">201</a>]&nbsp; Although rare, AML-related  renal hemorrhage during pregnancy may result in fetal or maternal demise; thus  this guideline is particularly recommended for women of child-bearing age who  desire to become pregnant.[<a href="#_ENREF_195" title="Nelson, 2002 #478">195</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_202" title="Mitchell, 2003 #487">202</a>]</p>
    <p>Given  the generally benign nature of AML, and given the propensity for multiple or  recurrent tumors in TS patients, preservation of renal function is a paramount  concern in treatment planning.&nbsp; Nephron-sparing  techniques such as partial nephrectomy[<a href="#_ENREF_199" title="Kutikov, 2006 #473">199</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_203" title="Boorjian, 2007 #482">203</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_204" title="Heidenreich, 2002 #484">204</a>] or vascular embolization[<a href="#_ENREF_205" title="Ramon, 2009 #485">205</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_206" title="Williams, 2006 #486">206</a>] are thus preferred to radical nephrectomy in  most patients, particularly children and young adults.&nbsp; Although it is more invasive than vascular  embolization, partial nephrectomy is less likely to result in the need for  repeated treatments; up to 40% of embolized tumors require further therapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_203" title="Boorjian, 2007 #482">203-206</a>]&nbsp;
&nbsp;   </p>
    <p><em>Metanephric tumors: Metanephric Adenoma, Metanephric Adenofibroma,  &amp; Metanephric Stromal Tumor </em><br>
Metanephric tumors represent a spectrum of tumor pathology, varying  based on the relative proportion of stroma and epithelium. Some authors have  suggested that these tumors represent the most hyperdifferentiated, mature form  of WT.[<a href="#_ENREF_207" title="Argani, 2005 #343">207</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; These tumors arise from the  renal medulla and are generally benign, although there have been rare (and  controversial) reports of malignant behavior.[<a href="#_ENREF_207" title="Argani, 2005 #343">207</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_208" title="Renshaw, 2000 #469">208</a>] </p>
  <p>Metanephric adenoma (MA) is a purely epithelial  lesion occurring across a wide range of ages (5 to 83 years in the largest  reported series).&nbsp; Most patients with MA  are adults, though children may be affected as well; there is a roughly 2:1  female predominance.[<a href="#_ENREF_209" title="Davis, 1995 #325">209</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_210" title="Jones, 1995 #450">210</a>]&nbsp; The  tumors are typically solid, though cysts may occur.&nbsp; Microscopically, these tumors are  unencapsulated but well demarcated, and are composed of embryonal epithelial  cells forming regular, closely packed tubular structures.&nbsp; Mitotic activity is rare.[<a href="#_ENREF_209" title="Davis, 1995 #325">209</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_210" title="Jones, 1995 #450">210</a>]&nbsp; On  immunohistochemistry, MA stains positive for WT-1, lending support to its  putative connection with WT;[<a href="#_ENREF_211" title="Muir, 2001 #470">211</a>] further support comes from reported cases of MA  occurring in patients with hemihypertrophy.[<a href="#_ENREF_212" title="Kupeli, 2009 #471">212</a>]&nbsp;  Clinically, MA tends to be found incidentally or as a palpable mass;  approximately 10% of MA patients also present with polycythemia, perhaps due to  direct production of erythropoietin.[<a href="#_ENREF_213" title="Yoshioka, 2007 #472">213</a>]&nbsp; Given  their benign behavior, these tumors are generally best managed by partial  nephrectomy.[<a href="#_ENREF_199" title="Kutikov, 2006 #473">199</a>]</p>
  <p>Metanephric stromal tumor (MST) is a purely stromal lesion occurring  predominantly in children (median age 13 months, range 2 days to 11 years),  though rare adult cases have been reported.[<a href="#_ENREF_214" title="Argani, 2000 #106">214</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_215" title="Bluebond-Langner, 2002 #474">215</a>]&nbsp; Both sexes are equally effected.&nbsp; Like MA, MST are more commonly solid, though  10% demonstrate cystic components, and are typically unencapsulated.[<a href="#_ENREF_214" title="Argani, 2000 #106">214</a>]&nbsp; Unlike MA, these centrally-located lesions  often infiltrate into the renal pelvis and occasionally into the renal sinus  and ureter.[<a href="#_ENREF_214" title="Argani, 2000 #106">214</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_216" title="Lorenzo, 2003 #475">216</a>]&nbsp; Microscopically, MST is also superficially  infiltrative, enclosing native renal tubules and vessels in an &ldquo;onion-skinning&rdquo;  pattern; these &ldquo;collarettes&rdquo; are typically surrounded by bland spindle cell  fascicles.&nbsp; Because of their tendency to  entrap entire glomeruli, MST induce juxtaglomerular cell hyperplasia in up to  25% of affected kidneys, resulting in rennin-dependent hypertension. On  immunohistochemistry, MST tends to stain positive for CD34 and vimentin.[<a href="#_ENREF_214" title="Argani, 2000 #106">214</a>]&nbsp; MST has been hypothesized to arise from  intralobar nephrogenic rests, further supporting the connection between WT and  metanephric tumors.[<a href="#_ENREF_207" title="Argani, 2005 #343">207</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_214" title="Argani, 2000 #106">214</a>]&nbsp; Clinically, these tumors may present with a  palpable renal mass or with hematuria due to renal pelvis involvement; MST are  generally treated with nephrectomy, though partial nephrectomy may be an  adequate treatment if negative margins can be achieved.[<a href="#_ENREF_214" title="Argani, 2000 #106">214-216</a>]&nbsp; There are no reports of MST exhibiting  malignant behavior.[<a href="#_ENREF_207" title="Argani, 2005 #343">207</a>]</p>
  <p>Metanephric adenofibroma (MAF) is a biphasic epithelial &amp;  stromal tumor, with a varying ratio of epithelium to stroma.[<a href="#_ENREF_217" title="Arroyo, 2001 #104">217</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_218" title="Hennigar, 1992 #164">218</a>]  Although the stromal component is identical to the bland spindle cell stroma  seen in MST, the epithelial component may be more mitotically active than MA.[<a href="#_ENREF_217" title="Arroyo, 2001 #104">217</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_218" title="Hennigar, 1992 #164">218</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp; Importantly, either WT and papillary RCC may  arise from the epithelial component of MAF,[<a href="#_ENREF_217" title="Arroyo, 2001 #104">217</a>] and  spindle-cell sarcomas (dubbed &ldquo;metanephric adenosarcoma&rdquo;) may arise from the  stromal component.[<a href="#_ENREF_219" title="Picken, 2001 #476">219</a>]&nbsp; Similar to MA and MST, MAF is also  unencapsulated, but with indistinct borders.&nbsp;  These tumors generally presents in children, though adults may be  affected (median age 2.5 years, range 5 months to 36 years); males are more  commonly affected (male to female ratio 2:1).[<a href="#_ENREF_217" title="Arroyo, 2001 #104">217</a>]&nbsp; As with MST, most patients have been treated  with radical nephrectomy, though partial nephrectomy is likely a reasonable  option provided that negative margins can be obtained.&nbsp; Because most of the reported patients were initially  diagnosed with WT, most received adjuvant chemotherapy; it is thus impossible  to comment on the natural history of patients treated with surgery alone.&nbsp; However, prognosis in patients with available  follow-up has been universally excellent.[<a href="#_ENREF_217" title="Arroyo, 2001 #104">217</a>]</p>

  <p>Like many renal tumors, CN can occur in adults or children.&nbsp; While in adults CN occurs far more commonly  in women (female to male ratio 8:1), the opposite is true in children (female  to male ratio 1:2).[<a href="#_ENREF_226" title="Zhou, 2009 #460">226</a>]&nbsp; In children, these tumors often present as a  palpable abdominal mass at a median 18 months of age.[<a href="#_ENREF_221" title="Luithle, 2007 #451">221</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_224" title="Joshi, 1989 #143">224</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_229" title="Boybeyi, 2008 #465">229</a>]&nbsp; Pathologically, CN is defined according to  the criteria of Joshi and Beckwith[<a href="#_ENREF_224" title="Joshi, 1989 #143">224</a>] as a discrete cystic tumor, well-demarcated from the normal  non-cystic renal parenchyma, without significant solid components.&nbsp; The cysts are lined by flattened, cuboidal,  or hobnail epithelium, while the septa contain only fibrous tissue or  well-differentiated renal tubules.[<a href="#_ENREF_224" title="Joshi, 1989 #143">224</a>]&nbsp; Owing to their benign  clinical course and well-demarcated structure, these tumors can be removed  using nephron-sparing surgery with no need for adjuvant chemotherapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_227" title="Ferrer, 1994 #453">227</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_230" title="Ashley, 2007 #260">230</a>]&nbsp; <br>
Similar to pediatric CN, CPDN occurs predominantly among boys, with  a 3:1 male to female ratio.[<a href="#_ENREF_220" title="Blakely, 2003 #232">220</a>]&nbsp; These tumors also present similarly to WT and  CN, most commonly as a palpable abdominal mass at a median age of 16 months.[<a href="#_ENREF_220" title="Blakely, 2003 #232">220</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_224" title="Joshi, 1989 #143">224</a>]&nbsp; CPDN is pathologically quite similar to CN,  with the primary difference between the two being the presence of immature or  blastemal cells in the septa of CPDN.[<a href="#_ENREF_223" title="Eble, 1998 #456">223</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_224" title="Joshi, 1989 #143">224</a>]&nbsp; Two pathologic subtypes of CPDN, conventional  and papillonodular, have been described.[<a href="#_ENREF_228" title="Joshi, 1990 #151">228</a>]&nbsp; Also similar to CN, CPDN  follows a generally benevolent course with few reported tumor recurrences  following surgical removal, which can be performed by either partial or radical  nephrectomy.[<a href="#_ENREF_220" title="Blakely, 2003 #232">220</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_221" title="Luithle, 2007 #451">221</a>]&nbsp; </p>
  <p>MEST is another tumor which is clinically and  pathologically similar to CN; several authors have proposed that these tumors  are in fact the same identity.[<a href="#_ENREF_225" title="Turbiner, 2007 #457">225</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_226" title="Zhou, 2009 #460">226</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_231" title="Lane, 2008 #463">231</a>]&nbsp; However,  unlike CN or CPDN, MEST occurs almost exclusively in adults, and as such will  not be discussed in detail here.<br>
  Lastly, multilocular cystic RCC can also occur among children,  though they are markedly more common among adults.[<a href="#_ENREF_232" title="Halat, 2010 #467">232</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_233" title="Menon, 2004 #466">233</a>]&nbsp; Cystic RCC is pathologically and  taxonomically distinct from other pediatric cystic neoplasms such as CN or  CPDN,[<a href="#_ENREF_223" title="Eble, 1998 #456">223</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_233" title="Menon, 2004 #466">233</a>] and  is generally considered to be a rare variant of clear cell RCC.[<a href="#_ENREF_232" title="Halat, 2010 #467">232</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_234" title="Webster, 2007 #459">234</a>]&nbsp; Cystic RCC can occur in the setting of  genetic predisposition, such as VHL or TS, or in the setting of acquired renal  conditions such as acquired cystic kidney disease.&nbsp; Importantly, cystic RCC is characterized by a  uniformly good prognosis following surgical resection by partial or radical  nephrectomy.[<a href="#_ENREF_232" title="Halat, 2010 #467">232-234</a>]&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Miscellaneous Rare Renal Tumors </strong><br>
    <em>Intrarenal Neuroblastoma</em><br>
Although neuroblastoma has been previously reported to arise from  within the kidney parenchyma,[<a href="#_ENREF_235" title="Sellaturay, 2006 #422">235</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_236" title="Serrano, 2002 #424">236</a>] this  entity is described in detail elsewhere in this text and we will therefore  refrain from discussing it further here. &nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor  (DSRCT) is an uncommon but aggressive tumor, with roughly 150 cases described  since the original report in 1989.[<a href="#_ENREF_237" title="Gerald, 1989 #408">237</a>]&nbsp; DSRCT most commonly arises from the  peritoneal serosa, with roughly 25% of tumors found in genitourinary sites.[<a href="#_ENREF_237" title="Gerald, 1989 #408">237</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_238" title="Furman, 1997 #403">238</a>]&nbsp; Rarely, these tumors may originate within the  renal parenchyma.[<a href="#_ENREF_239" title="Wang, 2007 #379">239</a>]&nbsp; Regardless of site of origin, DSRCT is characterized  by a single chromosomal translocation, t(11;22)(p13;q12).&nbsp; This translocation results in the fusion of  exon 7 of the Ewing sarcoma gene with exon 7 of Wilms&rsquo; tumor suppressor gene,  leading to a unique gene fusion product,<em> EWS-WT1</em>.[<a href="#_ENREF_240" title="Barnoud, 2000 #410">240-242</a>]&nbsp; </p>
  <p>As the name implies, DSRCT are microscopically  characterized by sheets of abundant small undifferentiated cells with scant  cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei.&nbsp; DSRCT  of the kidney typically demonstrates abundant mitotic figures and prominent  apoptosis and necrosis.&nbsp; The tumors are  unencapsulated, and tumor borders are uniformly infiltrative.[<a href="#_ENREF_239" title="Wang, 2007 #379">239</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_241" title="Lae, 2002 #405">241</a>]&nbsp; Because  the histologic appearance of DSRCT can easily be confused with other tumor  types, notably blastema-predominant WT and PNET,[<a href="#_ENREF_243" title="Valera, 2010 #407">243</a>] the diagnosis of DSRCT should be applied to a  primary renal tumor only in the presence of <em>EWS-WT1</em>staining.[<a href="#_ENREF_239" title="Wang, 2007 #379">239</a>]<br>
  With the exception of  a single case report in an adult,[<a href="#_ENREF_244" title="Su, 2004 #409">244</a>] DSRCT of the kidney occurs in young children  (mean age 6.8 years), and, in contradistinction to extrarenal DSRCT, is  slightly more common in girls.[<a href="#_ENREF_239" title="Wang, 2007 #379">239</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_245" title="Eaton, 2006 #415">245</a>]&nbsp; Tumors  tend to appear hypovascular, heterogeneous, and well-circumscribed by  ultrasound and computed tomography.[<a href="#_ENREF_246" title="Egloff, 2005 #406">246</a>]&nbsp; Although  extrarenal DSRCT has a dismal prognosis, 2 of 4 reported patients had no  evidence of disease at last follow-up, while the remaining 2 have had a stable  clinical course following multi-modality therapy.[<a href="#_ENREF_239" title="Wang, 2007 #379">239</a>]&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em>Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor </em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor  (PNET) is thought to be a part of the Ewing&rsquo;s sarcoma family, most commonly  found in bone or soft tissue.&nbsp; Although  Ewing&rsquo;s is a relatively common tumor, primary intrarenal PNET is quite rare,  with roughly 50 pediatric cases reported in the literature.[<a href="#_ENREF_247" title="Ellinger, 2006 #417">247-252</a>]&nbsp; PNET is frequently noted to have one of two  balanced chromosomal translocations (t(11;22)(q24;q12) and t(21;22)(q22;q12)),  which result in fusion of the <em>EWS</em> gene with <em>FLI1</em> or <em>ERG</em>, respectively.[<a href="#_ENREF_253" title="Delattre, 1994 #419">253</a>]&nbsp; These gene fusion products are expressed in  &gt;95% of tumors and can be readily detected by FISH or PCR for diagnostic  purposes.[<a href="#_ENREF_249" title="Karnes, 2000 #412">249</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_250" title="Marley, 1997 #420">250</a>]&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intrarenal PNET typically occurs in  adolescents or young adults at a median age of 24 years (range 4 to 66 years).[<a href="#_ENREF_247" title="Ellinger, 2006 #417">247</a>]&nbsp; Histologically, intrarenal  PNET is identical to PNET in other locations, with sheets or rosettes of small  ovoid cells and a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio.[<a href="#_ENREF_251" title="Parham, 2001 #227">251</a>]&nbsp; Strong membrane immunohistochemical staining  for CD99 is a nearly universal feature.[<a href="#_ENREF_248" title="Ellison, 2007 #247">248</a>]&nbsp;<br>
PNET typically presents  with abdominal or flank pain, hematuria, or the presence of a palpable mass;  most tumors are detected at an advanced stage.[<a href="#_ENREF_247" title="Ellinger, 2006 #417">247</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_248" title="Ellison, 2007 #247">248</a>]&nbsp; Inferior  vena cava thrombi are not uncommonly present (33%) at the time of diagnosis, as  are metastases to the lymph nodes (25%), lung (20%), and liver (14%).[<a href="#_ENREF_247" title="Ellinger, 2006 #417">247</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_249" title="Karnes, 2000 #412">249</a>]&nbsp; Of  patients with available follow-up data, 43% had died of disease within 2 years  of their diagnosis, despite an aggressive multi-modality treatment regimen. </p>
  <p><em>Anaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney  (ASK) has only recently been described as a distinct pathologic entity.[<a href="#_ENREF_254" title="Vujanic, 2007 #249">254</a>]&nbsp; These tumors are quite rare with only 21  reported cases,[<a href="#_ENREF_254" title="Vujanic, 2007 #249">254</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_255" title="Labanaris, 2009 #440">255</a>]&nbsp; and may be confused with anaplastic WT. &nbsp;Grossly, ASK is typically a large, soft, and  friable tumor, with mixed cystic and solid architecture in one-third of  cases.&nbsp; Histologically, these tumors  consistently demonstrate a spindle cell component arranged in fascicles; as the  name implies, anaplasia is universally present, with &ldquo;bizarre, pleomorphic,  multinucleated&rdquo; cells commonly present.&nbsp;  Chondroid differentiation is commonly present, and ASK tumors often  stain positive for vimentin and desmin.[<a href="#_ENREF_254" title="Vujanic, 2007 #249">254</a>] </p>
   ASK  occurs at a median age of 5 years (range 10 months to 41 years), with a slight  female predominance (female to male ratio 1.5 to 1).[<a href="#_ENREF_254" title="Vujanic, 2007 #249">254</a>]&nbsp; A  palpable renal mass and/or flank pain are the most common presenting symptoms,  with hematuria occurring less frequently.&nbsp;  The most common sites of metastases were lung (15%), liver (10%), and  bone (10%). Of 14 patients with known follow-up, 3 (21%) had died at a mean 1.6  years after diagnosis; the remaining 11 (79%) were alive at a mean follow-up of  7.4 years.[<a href="#_ENREF_254" title="Vujanic, 2007 #249">254</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_255" title="Labanaris, 2009 #440">255</a>]  
  <p><em>Miscellaneous Rare Primary Renal Tumors </em><br>
In addition to the non-WT pediatric primary renal tumors detailed  above, multiple other neoplastic entities have been reported to rarely  originate within the kidney parenchyma.&nbsp;  These include tumors which are typically extrarenal or typically occur  in adults, such as synovial sarcoma,[<a href="#_ENREF_256" title="Argani, 2000 #105">256</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_257" title="Mirza, 2008 #448">257</a>] rhabdomyosarcoma,[<a href="#_ENREF_258" title="Raney, 2008 #441">258</a>]  lymphoma,[<a href="#_ENREF_259" title="Dobkin, 1991 #442">259</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_260" title="Jindal, 2009 #443">260</a>] leiomyosarcoma,[<a href="#_ENREF_261" title="Norton, 1997 #444">261</a>] liposarcoma,[<a href="#_ENREF_262" title="Itzchak, 1975 #445">262</a>] malignant fibrous histiocytoma,[<a href="#_ENREF_263" title="Cole, 1993 #446">263</a>] and  even melanoma.[<a href="#_ENREF_264" title="Ehara, 1997 #447">264</a>]&nbsp; However, it should be noted  that these tumors are prohibitively rare among children.&nbsp; <br>
