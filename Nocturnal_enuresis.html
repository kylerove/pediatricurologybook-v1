  <p>Bedwetting or nocturnal enuresis has been said to be the most common  childhood condition affecting an estimated 5 -7,000,000 American children over  the age of 6 years(1).&nbsp; There are  multiple publications on prevalence rates worldwide that show remarkable  consistency.&nbsp; Among Australian children,  aged 5-12 years-old, the overall prevalence of any nocturnal enuresis was 18.9%  and 15% for isolated bedwetting (2).&nbsp; The  majority of children were affected less than once per month.&nbsp; Marked enuresis, defined as at least weekly,  occurred in 5%, with a male preponderance.&nbsp;  The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPC) surveyed  11,251, of whom 8,269(73.5%) responded with15.5% of 7.5 year-olds wetting the  bed, 83% doing so at most once a week (3). They used the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV ) definition of  nocturnal enuresis as the involuntary passage of urine during sleep, with a  severity of at least twice a week in children over 5 years of age.&nbsp; In Hong Kong, nocturnal enuresis, defined as  at least one wet night every 3 months, affects 16% of 5 year olds, 10% of 7  year-olds and 2.6% of 10 year-olds (4).&nbsp;  Nocturnal enuresis (not defined) has been reported in 5.6% of 5-13 year  old Korean children (5).</p>
  <p>Despite these differences in definitions the prevalence rates are  remarkably similar.&nbsp; Whilst focussing on  these differences in definitions may seem like semantic pedantry there are  negative implications for comparison and meta-analysis (6).&nbsp; This prompted the International Continence  Society in 1973 to establish a committee for the standardization of terminology  of lower urinary tract function.&nbsp; This  led in 1998 to the publication of standards and definitions of lower urinary  tract symptoms and dysfunction in children (7).&nbsp;  Advances in research and understanding of the pathophysiology of  enuresis prompted the need to provide &ldquo;firm and unequivocal guidelines for the  terminology of LUT function and malfunction in childhood&rdquo; by the International  Children&rsquo;s Continence Society(8).&nbsp; Their  recommendation is that the term &lsquo;enuresis&rsquo; be reserved for any king of  intermittent urinary incontinence that occurs during sleep.&nbsp; The descriptor &lsquo;nocturnal&rsquo; can be used if  desired but is not necessary as the term &lsquo;diurnal enuresis&rsquo; is now obsolete,  having been replaced by the simpler and more descriptive &lsquo;daytime  incontinence&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>Enuretics still compose a very heterogeneous population of patients.&nbsp; Primary enuretics are defined as those who  have never had a sustained period of night-time dryness of 6 months or longer  in duration.&nbsp; Those who have are deemed  to have secondary enuresis.&nbsp; This  distinction is probably of little clinical relevance in patients who have  mono-symptomatic nocturnal enuresis (9).&nbsp;  Mono-symptomatic nocturnal enuresis describes those patients with  nocturnal enuresis in the absence of ANY other lower urinary tract symptom,  i.e. increased or decreased frequency of micturition, daytime urinary  incontinence, urgency, hesitancy, straining, a weak urinary  stream,intermittency, voiding postponement maneuvers, a feeling of incomplete  micturition, post-micturition dribble and genital or lower urinary tract pain.&nbsp; The combination of any of these symptoms and  enuresis defines the enuresis as nonmonosymptomatic.&nbsp; The remainder of this chapter will deal with  monosymptomatic enuresis.<br>

<p><strong><u>Genetics/Aetiology</u></strong></p>
  <p>The ALSPC project reported that odds ratio for a child developing  severe nocturnal enuresis (defined as 2 or more episodes per week) were 3.63  times higher if there was a maternal history of enuresis and 1.85 times higher  with a paternal history (10).&nbsp; Where both  parents have a history of nocturnal enuresis there is a 77% chance of the offspring  developing enuresis (11).&nbsp; There is a  suggestion that children with &lsquo;familial&rsquo; enuresis may have a more refractory  variant with more symptoms/signs of mixed enuresis rather than monosymptomatic  enuresis (12).&nbsp; Enuresis has been linked  thru segregation and linkage studies to a number of chromosomes including 8q,  12q, 13q and 22q.&nbsp; In a large study by  Loeys et al looking at 32 families with 2 to 4 generations of enuretics they  found linkages to chromosomes 22q11, 13q13-14(ENUR1) and 12q with marked genetic  and symptomatic/phenotypic heterogeneity (13).&nbsp;  Several families had linkages to more than one locus, suggesting a  polygenic mode of inheritance.&nbsp;  Segregation analysis suggests that the most common mode of inheritance  is autosomal dominant with high penetrance (14).&nbsp; It is important to understand that ENUR1 or  the &lsquo;enuresis gene&rsquo; per say has not been identified but rather that some  patients with familial enuresis have been shown to have inherited two specific  micro-satellite markers 13q13 and 13q14.2 and the ENUR1 gene is coded somewhere  in the 5,000,000 nucleotides between these two markers.&nbsp; However even in large families with  hereditary enuresis there is marked heterogeneity within and between families  with respect to phenotypic pattern of enuresis i.e. primary/secondary,  monosymptomatic/nonmonosymptomatic (15). However they did find a stronger  correlation within families in terms of nocturnal polyuria and daytime voided  volumes.<br>
    Twin studies provide strong support for environmental modification  of a genetic predisposition in the aetiology of enuresis.&nbsp; Bakwin in 1971 reporting on 338 pairs of same  sex twins found 68% concordance for enuresis in monozygotic twins and 36%  concordance in dizygotic twins.&nbsp; In a  much larger Finnish population based study the concordance rate for enuresis  amongst monozygotic twins was 46% compared to 19% for dizygotic twins (16).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><u>Physiology/Pathophysiology</u></strong></p>
  <p>In 2000 Butler and Holland proposed &ldquo;The Three Systems Model&rdquo; to  facilitate our understanding of the pathogenesis of enuresis and to encourage  more directed and focussed therapeutic interventions (17).&nbsp; They proposed that enuresis was the end  result of dysfunction in one or more of the following three &lsquo;systems&rsquo; - i) the  normal diurnal variation in Vasopressin release during sleep, ii) detrusor  overactivity, iii) normal sleep/arousal mechanisms.&nbsp; This model continues to have strong validity  today though on reading the literature it is evident that individual  sub-specialties place greater emphasis on the different elements. Though with  our improved understanding the three systems have evolved into - i) Relative  nocturnal polyuria, ii)&nbsp; Nocturnal  bladder dysfunction, iii) Neurological Developmental Delay.</p>
  <p><strong>Nocturnal Polyuria</strong></p>
  <p>An understanding of renal physiology, that has increased enormously  over the past twenty years, is central to understanding the pahophysiology of  enuresis and the potential therapeutic options available.</p>
  <p>The kidney is tasked with maintaining extracellular fluid  homeostasis within a very narrow range of 280-295mOsm/kg and has to do this  under circumstances that vary both from day to day and hour to hour within that  day.&nbsp; It does this thru&rsquo; a combination of  passive excretion or filtration and active secretion.&nbsp; The average adult kidney filters 150-180l per  day, absorbing the vast majority of it, 90%, in the proximal convoluted tubule  and loop of Henle.&nbsp; The remaining 10%  passes into the distal/collecting tubules where variable amounts of salt and  water are reabsorbed under the influence of Aldosterone and Vasopressin  respectively.&nbsp; Urine volume is largely  under the control of Vasopressin which increases the reabsorption of water in  the collecting tubules.&nbsp; The volume of  urine produced is also influenced by solute load.&nbsp; Urine concentration of solute is controlled  by two different but interactive mechanisms - ADH or Vasopressin changes the  volume of urine by influencing water reabsorption and the  Renin/Angiotensin/Aldosterone system influences solute, primarily sodium  excretion or retention (18).</p>
  <p>Vasopressin is released in response to a rise in plasma osmolality  detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. It&rsquo;s mechanism of action at a  renal level remained something of a mystery until Agre et in 1992,described a  water channel which they would call Aquaporin (19).&nbsp; These transmembrane proteins in monomeric  form create a transmembrane pore that resembles an hour-glass.&nbsp; In situ they <br>
coalesce to form tetramers with a ~3&Aring; thru which a single water  molecule of ~2.8&Aring; can pass at a rate of 3 X 109 water molecules per  monomer per second (20).&nbsp; Aquaporin 1  (AQP1) is constitutively expressed and is responsible for the majority of renal  water reabsorption that occurs in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle.&nbsp; Aquaporin 2 is the major Vasopressin  regulated Aquaporin.&nbsp; Its expression  levels on the apical membranes of the collecting duct is tightly regulated by  Vasopressin, which binds to the V2 receptor on the cell surface and triggers  the exocytic expression of AQP2 from vesicles within the cell to the apical  surface.&nbsp; Removal of Vasopressin results  in endocytosis (recycling) of AQP back into intra-cellular vesicles.&nbsp; AQP3 and AQP4, situated on basal and lateral  membranes, are responsible for the release of intracellular water back into the  circulation.&nbsp; So significant was the  discovery by Agre that in 2003 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry,  which he shared with Roderick MacKinnon who discovered ion channels (<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2003/public.html"><strong>http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2003/public.htm</strong>l</a>).</p>
  <p>It has long been known that in the normal state we produce more  urine during the day than at night.&nbsp;  Roberts in 1860 noted that in urine, 4.5 times as much water was  excreted by day as by night and that twice as much &lsquo;solid constituents&rsquo;.&nbsp; This is why the average individual can go 2.5  - 4 hours during the day between voids but can refrain from voiding for up to 8  hours overnight.&nbsp; Poulton in 1952,  published on the volume of urine produced by 100 enuretic children and 18  controls and noted that there was a diurnal rhythm of urine production in both  but that it was more blunted in the enuretic group (21).&nbsp; He found a day to night ratio of urine  production to be 1.8 or greater in the control group and less than that in 69%  of the symptomatic group with some as low as 1.0 suggesting no diurnal  variation at all. It was he who first coined the term <em>relative nocturnal polyuria</em>.</p>
  <p>Research into this phenomenon lay dormant until the seminal work by  Rittig et al in Denmark who very elegantly demonstrated (in a very well  controlled setting) a markedly blunted diurnal circadian rhythm of plasma  Vasopressin levels in enuretic children compared with healthy controls  (22).&nbsp; The night plasma level of  Vasopressin was significantly lower in the affected children.&nbsp; Similarly they found that both groups  produced a similar volume of urine in a 24 hour period by normal healthy  children demonstrated a marked reduction in nocturnal urine output reduced by  almost 66% whereas enuretic children demonstrated no such reduction.&nbsp; They also demonstrated a circadian rhythm to  urine osmolality that was reciprocal to urine volume in healthy controls and  the absence of such a rhythm in enuretics.&nbsp;  This led to great optimism for treatment of enuretics with nocturnal  polyuria with dDAVP.</p>
  <p>Why is it that Desmopressin (dDAVP) treatment will induce a response  in over 70% with a reduction in wet nights but only cures 24.5%?&nbsp; Why do not all enuretics with nocturnal  polyuria respond to Desmopressin?&nbsp; At  least in part this may be due to an increased solute load at night, which  independently has the ability to increase urine volume.&nbsp; This is corroborated by the fact that at  least in part tricyclic antidepressants are thought to reduce enuresis by  decreasing nocturnal solute excretion (23).&nbsp;  Again Rittig et al very elegantly demonstrated that in a subgroup of  enuretics their nocturnal polyuria was associated with a significant  natriuresis with an associated absence of nocturnal increase in Angiotensin II  or Aldosterone.&nbsp; Aceto et al found a  similar association between enuresis, nocturnal polyuria and nocturnal sodium  excretion (24).&nbsp; That same group also  found an association between nocturnal polyuria and absorptive  hypercalciuria.&nbsp; Despite the selection  bias of referral to a tertiary referral centre paediatric Nephrologist in  Ghent, Belgium found hypercalciuria in 12% of enuretic children, which they  felt probably reflected dietary intake rather than primary hypercalciuria such  as that seen in the work by Caione et al from Italy (25).&nbsp; Valenti et al found that urinary Aquaporin 2  levels correlated well with severity of enuresis (26).&nbsp; In normal children the ratio of urinary  excretion of AQP2 from day to night was 0.6 as compared to 1.2 in enuretics.&nbsp; Furthermore they found that low levels of  Vasopressin and hypercalciuria were independently associated with a two-fold  increase in urinary day/night AQP ratio and that low vasopressin levels when  associated with hypercalciuria resulted in a three-fold increase.&nbsp; Not everyone believes that hypercalciuria is  causative of enuresis (27).&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite  their misgivings there has been some recent work to suggest that hypercalciuria  acting via the Apical Calcium-sensing Receptor interfere with the function of  Vasopressin resulting in increased urinary excretion of AQP and diuresis  (28).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Other hormones that have been investigated include Atrial  Natriuretic Peptide ( no clear association) and Prostaglandin E2, which has a  clear diurnal variation in normal children with a 30% drop overnight  (29,30).&nbsp; Looking closer at PGE2 which is  a known antagonist of Vasopressin, the Danish group again found significantly  elevated levels of urinary PGE2 in enuretics with nocturnal polyuria,  refractory to Desmopressin therapy, when compared to healthy controls,  non-polyuric enuretics and enuretics who had a dry night (31). </p>
  <p>It is evident that a large proportion of  enuretics have nocturnal polyuria.&nbsp;  However not all of these are due to a deficiency of vasopressin.  Furthermore everyone with nocturnal polyuria will have enuresis, they may have  nocturia i.e wake to void. <br>

<p><strong>Nocturnal Bladder  Dysfunction</strong></p>
  <p>As early as 1878, Ruddock felt that the cause of enuresis may lay  with a hypertrophic bladder with increased contractility (32).&nbsp; There is a well established association  between enuresis and daytime bladder dysfunction with 20% or so of enuretics  also having daytime symptoms i.e nonmonosymptomatic enuresis.&nbsp; For these patients it would seem logical that  at least in part bladder dysfunction would contribute to their enuresis.&nbsp; In monosymptomatic enuretics however there  has been a traditional understanding that their underlying bladder function was  normal.&nbsp; Video-urodynamics carried out in  enuretic patients confirmed this assumption by failing to show an increased  rate of Detrusor Overactivity when compared to healthy controls, when the  patients were awake.&nbsp; In 1989 Watanabe  reported their results with combined overnight EEG and cystometry in 204 enuretics,  and 3 healthy controls (33).&nbsp; Based on  their work they were able to divide enuretic patients into three groups.<br>
    Type I (61%) - similar bladder response to filling as healthy  controls, however as the bladder capacity was approached and the first detrusor  contraction was seen on cystometry, the sleep stage changed but not to the  extent of awakening before enuresis occurred.<br>
    Type IIa (11%) - similar findings whilst asleep as normal subjects,  however neither the first detrusor contraction as bladder capacity is  approached nor enuresis itself were associated with a change in EEG.<br>
    Type IIb (28%) - similar findings on EEG, but when patients entered  deep sleep the cystometry demonstrated continuous uninhibited detrusor  contractions (not seen when awake) and enuresis occurred without noticeable change  in EEG.</p>
  <p>These subtypes and fractional percentages were confirmed by the same  group with a larger series of 826 patients in 1994 (34).&nbsp; They did not find any difference in  functional bladder capacity between enuretics and non-enuretics after the age  of 7 years old.</p>
  <p>Yeung et al in Hong Kong used a combination of natural fill  cystometry by day and simultaneous cystometry and EEG during sleep in 95  patients with enuresis refractory to treatment with Desmopressin and or alarm  therapy (35).&nbsp; They were able to  distinguish between two subgroups in this population Group A (35%) had normal  daytime bladder function but demonstrated significant detrusor overactivity and  a marked reduction in functional bladder capacity after falling asleep.&nbsp; Group B (65%) had a similar pattern when  asleep but also abnormal daytime urodynamics which were previously  undetected.&nbsp; The emphasize the importance  of a detailed history and frequency volume chart to search out those enuretics  who have subconsciously adapted their daytime behavior to mitigate the symptoms  of their bladder dysfunction (36).&nbsp; The  use of a diary and frequency volume chart to unearth subclinical daytime  urinary symptoms or to try to quantify nocturnal polyuria must be interpreted  with caution and over a sufficient length of time as there can be marked day to  day intra-individual variability in functional bladder capacity and night-time  urine volumes but this variability evens out over the course of a week or so  (37).</p>
  <p>Further evidence for the interplay between the three systems of  Butler and Hollands model comes from the finding that use of the pad and bell  alarm system, thought to address abnormalities of arousal or wakefulness in  fact also alters nocturnal bladder capacity.&nbsp;  Oredesson demonstrated an increase in nocturnal bladder capacity from a  mean of 270mls pre-alarm treatment to 370mls after 6 weeks of alarm therapy, in  the 10 of 18 patients who became dry (38).&nbsp;  Even in the 8/18 that did not become dry they demonstrated an increase  nocturnal bladder capacity from 235 to 294mls after 6 weeks of treatment.&nbsp; Both groups had acceptable daytime capacities  of 345 and 315 respectively prior to initiation of treatment suggesting  monosymptomatic enuresis.&nbsp; Norgaard et  demonstrated detrusor contractions in 50 % of enuretics during sleep cystometry  which could be increased to 100% by forced diuresis (39).&nbsp; This supports a role for interplay between  factors that may cause nocturnal polyuria and nocturnal detrusor overactivity.</p>
  <p><strong>Neurological Developmental  Delay</strong></p>
  <p>In 1879, Powers described experiments carried out by Goltz, who  while cleaning dogs with divided spinal cords noticed that touching the  perineum with a wet sponge induced micturition and attributed this to a release  from &lsquo;higher mental influences&rsquo; similar to when asleep (32).</p>
  <p>Just as it important to have an understanding of the renal  mechanisms that control urine volume so too should a urologist understand the  neural control of bladder function.&nbsp; Over  the last twenty years our understanding of the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological  control of bladder function (storage and micturition) has increased  enormously.&nbsp; This seemingly simple  biological function requires very complex integration of&nbsp; autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic)  and somatic nervous systems to control both smooth and striated  musculature.&nbsp; All of this happens under  the control and supervision of higher cerebral structures that reflect an  acquired or learned behavior.&nbsp; Even now  there is still much to learn with still differing models of the control of  micturition.&nbsp; A detailed discussion of  this subject is beyond the scope of this text and the reader is referred to the  works of DeGroat, Holstege and Blok (40, 41, 42).</p>
  <p> Unlike many animals humans and born whilst still  very developmentally immature both physically and mentally/neurologically  (43).&nbsp; It now appears that 5/6 of the  human brain growth occurs post-natally with rapid myelination not being  completed until about the age of 3-4 years old.&nbsp;  This explains the gradual and progressive attainment of developmental  milestones such as sitting at <img width="276" height="454" src="Nocturnal_enuresis_clip_image002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="12">7months, crawling at 9months, walking and 12  months and the slower rates of progress for more higher functions such as  talking, understanding, socializing etc.&nbsp;  We know that bladder control is similarly an acquired phenomenon  progressing from the automatic or reflexive emptying of a neonate&rsquo;s bladder to  the volitional ability to both refrain from and initiate bladder emptying on  demand that follows successful toilet training.&nbsp;  Koff argues that to draw a line in the sand and say that beyond that  time a previously accepted normal occurrence is now a pathological process  rather than merely a reflection of delayed development is counter-intuitative  (44).&nbsp; Based on much of the evidence  already presented he proposes the existence of a dual developmental delay in  their CNS.&nbsp; Afferent developmental delay  - resulting in a failure of the CNS to recognize and respond to bladder  distention and contraction (similar to Watanabe&rsquo;s Types IIa and I).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  Efferent developmental delay - a failure of the CNS to suppress the  reflex micturition arc whilst patient is asleep, must be associated also with a  failure to awaken.</p>
  <p>Javelin, in 1989, reported on the neurological development of 156  enuretics and 170 control, 7 year-old&nbsp;  children looking at their development and perinatal histories and  administering a test of motor impairment (45).&nbsp;  He like others found more fine and gross motor clumsiness in enuretic  children.&nbsp; Enuretic children also has  slower growth rates suggesting that isolated enuresis was associated with an  obvious developmental delay.&nbsp; Furthermore  those patients had the greater genetic influence suggesting that the  developmental delay was genetic in origin.&nbsp;  Peri-natal events did not have any significant association with monosymptomatic  enuresis but small for dates, asphyxia and other neurological injury during the  neonatal period was associated with a higher risk of developing  nonmonosymptomatic enuresis.&nbsp; Others have  also found evidence of generalized neuromotor delay and specific brainstem  dysfunction in enuretics (46). That same group also found evidence of  maturational delay in the motor cortex of the cerebrum (47).&nbsp; Ornitz et al have very cleverly used the  Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) of a startle reflex to model the reflex inhibition of  bladder contraction during filling mediated by the Pedunculopontine Tegmental  Nucleus&nbsp; via the L-region of the Pontine  micturition centre (48).&nbsp; In short the  prepulse inhibition reflex is a blunting of the normal startle reflex in  response to an auditory, visual <img width="247" height="381" src="Nocturnal_enuresis_clip_image002_0000.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="12">or tactile stimulus by prior sensitization with a much weaker  stimulus 120 msec before.&nbsp; Compared to  control children enuretics have a deficient PPI response.&nbsp; Interestingly this deficiency remains even  after the enuresis has resolved suggesting a possible inherited trait which  predisposes to enuresis rather than a developmental delay per say (49).</p>

  <p>When families are  asked what they believe to be the cause of enuresis they almost universally  point to the depth of sleep of the patient and an inability to wake them.&nbsp; However numerous sleep studies have  demonstrated a normal sleep architecture and that enuretic episodes occur  during all stages of sleep.&nbsp; It is their  rousability that is impaired.&nbsp; Wolfish  demonstrated that enuretic males were more difficult to wake that age-matched  controls with 9.3% of the former and 39.7% of the latter responding to acoustic  stimuli up to 120dB (50).&nbsp; This is  consistent with the experience of parents who &lsquo;lift&rsquo; their child to void at  night usually noting that they can do so without appearing to fully  awaken.&nbsp; Furthermore alarm therapy is  often abandoned early because of a failure to wake the patient despite waking  all other members of the household.&nbsp; A  recent report using different technology&nbsp;  (an Actigraph - which documents movement) carried out in the patients  home environment rather in a hospital setting has suggested enuretics do not  have a normal sleep architecture as previously stated but rather have more  fragmented sleep with more nighttime awakenings and more movement during  sleep(51).&nbsp; This is not incompatible with  previous work rather more sleep disturbance may result in more sleep  deprivation and therefore higher arousal thresholds.</p>
  <p>There have been multiple conflicting reports of associations between  enuresis and other parasomnias such as sleep walking, sleep talking, nightmares  etc. There has long been held a belief of an association between upper airway  obstruction and enuresis.&nbsp; In the late  1800&rsquo;s an association of mouth breathing and enuresis was attributed to  carbonic acid poisoning (32).&nbsp; More  recently a report from Turkey looked at 321 children who underwent  adeno-tonsillectomy, of whom 111 had enuresis pre-operatively (52).&nbsp; Seventy four of the enuretics were available  for assessment post operatively of whom 47 no longer complained of enuresis,  and 3 had a reduced frequency.&nbsp; They  report a 63% cure rate which even with an intention to treat analysis of the  original 111 would still be 46%.</p>
  <p><img src="text/images for nocturnal enu/fig3.jpg" width="450" height="368"></p>
  <p>Ultimately enuresis occurs because of a failure of the patient to  awaken to void once the volume of urine in the bladder approaches/exceeds its  capacity to contain it.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Diagnosis</u></strong></p>
  <p>The diagnosis of enuresis is fundamentally a clinical one, based  almost entirely on the history obtained from the patient and parent.&nbsp; What is crucial in the taking of that history  is firstly to exclude other forms of urinary incontinence, whether that be  mixed day and night-time incontinence suggestive of an underlying bladder  dysfunction, continuous incontinence suggestive of structural or anatomical  abnormalities or secondary enuresis more suggestive of&nbsp; other medical or psychological causes (53).</p>
  <p>The history taken should be extensive and exhaustive covering all of  the areas outlined above.&nbsp; The nature of  the urinary incontinence (day or night), the frequency of occurrence (relates  to prognosis), the severity and timing (may influence treatment selection), the  duration of symptoms (primary or secondary), the presence of other daytime  symptoms suggestive of bladder dysfunction (frequency, urgency, postponement  maneuvers), history of urinary tract infections, dietary intake (timing,  nature of food/fluids etc), bowel habit including faecal incontinence,  behavioral problems (ADHD, learning difficulties, sleep  disturbances/parasomnias), snoring or sleep apnoea.&nbsp; It is important to understand the past  medical history including pre-natal and perinatal events, and developmental  history.&nbsp; Family history of enuresis as  it points to prognosis.&nbsp; Social history  as multiple life events (e.g. new sibling, parental separation etc.) may point  to psychological comorbidity.</p>
  <p>As these patients are often withdrawn and introspective (at least at  the initial consultation) physical examination can safely be kept to a minimum  of anthropometric measurement (to partially exclude developmental delay), blood  pressure and urinalysis (to exclude renal pathology), abdominal palpation (for  evidence of fecal loading if the history suggests it).&nbsp; In the absence of features suggestive on  history genital/perineal examination is rarely indicated, nor is a detailed  neurological examination (beyond watching the patient walk into the examination  room) (54).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><u>Investigations</u></strong></p>
  <p>Few if any investigations are necessary in monosymptomatic enuresis  beyond urinalysis.&nbsp; Though not strictly  speaking an investigation a detailed frequency/voiding or elimination diary is  the most useful investigative tool.&nbsp; It  may help to direct therapy by documenting nocturnal polyuria or by unmasking  daytime symptomatology.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Management</u></strong></p>
  <p>One study found that 23 to 36 percent of parents had used punishment  as their primary means of dealing with bed-wetting (55). </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew that bedwetting was a) wicked and b) outside my  control....It was therefore possible to sin without knowing you committed it,  without wanting to commit it, and without being able to avoid it.....The double  beating was a turning point for it brought home to me for the first time the  harshness of the environment into which I had been flung....I had a conviction  of sin and folly and weakness such as I don&rsquo;t remember to have had before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Modern day medical management of nocturnal enuresis has come a long  way from punishment or shaving the testicle of hare into fragrant wine to  drink.&nbsp; In 1545 the comb of a cockerel or  the stones of a hedgehog were used in a similar manner (32).</p>
  <p>The essential prerequisites for successful treatment of nocturnal  enuresis are a motivated child, understanding and co-operative parents, with  realistic expectations, and an enthusiastic, interested and informed therapist  (57).&nbsp; For primary nocturnal enuresis the  therapist may be the family doctor, clinical nurse practitioner, continence  physiotherapist, paediatrician or paediatric urologist.</p>
  <p>Prior to commencing any medical&nbsp;  intervention simple behavioral modifications based on the patients  history and elimination diary are appropriate.&nbsp;  This is often referred to as urotherapy.&nbsp;  For the most part these are common sense suggestions based on what has  been written above.&nbsp; Patients should have  a regular voiding habit during the day and obviously last thing at night before  retiring.&nbsp; They should consume an  appropriate volume, of the right kinds of fluids e.g water rather than soft  drinks, at the right time - i.e drink the majority early in the day and  afternoon and limit fluids at bedtime to only that required to quench  thirst.&nbsp;&nbsp; They should eat sensibly,  sufficient to avoid or treat constipation and should refrain where possible  from heavy meals laden with calcium and salt near bedtime.&nbsp; This often proves difficult as it many  western families the main meal of the day is consumed in the evenings close to  the bedtime of enuretic 7-10 year olds.</p>
  <p>Though there is no direct evidence to support these simple clinical  measures in monosymptomatic enuresis.&nbsp;  They place little additional burden and there is some circumstantial  evidence that constipation for example is almost five times more common in  enuretics than non-enuretics (58).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>With these simple and intuitive measures in place adjunctive therapy  should be considered.</p>
  <p>For a comprehensive review of the management of  nocturnal enuresis in children and adolescents the reader is directed to the National  Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for management  of nocturnal enuresis, published in October 2010 by the NHS in the UK (<a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13246/51367/51367.pdf">http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13246/51367/51367.pdf</a>).&nbsp; We will touch herein, upon the various  treatment options available which logically attempt to address the underlying  pathological abnormalities in the three systems described above.&nbsp; Some authors have suggested sub-dividing  nocturnal enuresis into Desmopressin-dependent and Detrusor-dependent  sub-categories.</p>
  <p><u>Desmopressin</u></p>
  <p>Desmopressin therapy has its origins in the use of pituitary, and  later posterior pituitary, snuff to reduce urine volume.&nbsp; The first report of pituitrin snuff to treat  diabetes insipidus was made in 1924 and in 1925 it was used to treat nocturnal  enuresis in children for the first time.&nbsp;  It was not until 1955 that a blinded cross-over trial of Di-sipidin (posterior  pituitary snuff) versus placebo was carried out by Marson in Leeds (59).&nbsp; He found a marked reduction in the incidence  of enuresis during snuff treatment in 4 selected adolescents.</p>
  <p>Nowadays Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of Vasopressin, availa<img width="264" height="348" src="Nocturnal_enuresis_clip_image002.gif" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="12">ble since 1980, is used.&nbsp;  Desmopressin, or dDAVP, is created by de-aminating the cysteine residue  (which prolongs its activity) at one end of Vasopressin and replacing  L-arginine with D-arginine (which reduces the vasopressor activity).&nbsp; In so doing this renders dDAVP a potent  antidiuretic with reduced vasopressor activity and a prolonged half-life of  1.5-3.5 hours compared to about 12 mins for Vasopressin (60).&nbsp; The time to maximal biological activity  following ingestion is approximately 60 mins (61).&nbsp; Its rapid onset of action means that it is  often recommended where a quick response (such as going on overnight camps,  sleepovers etc) is needed.</p>
  <p>There is clear evidence that when compared to placebo Desmopressin  reduces bed-wetting by one to two nights (62).&nbsp;  People receiving Desmopressin are almost twice as likely as those on  placebo of being cured (defined as achieving 14 consecutive dry nights.&nbsp; The short term success rate for Desmopressin  therapy is 69% (range 32-100%) with long-term success rates of 45.7% (range  7-78%) (63).&nbsp; With improved patient  selection though the use of minor invasive diagnostic tests such as micturating  cystourethrography, Cystometrography and video-cystometrography the short term  success rates improve to 84%(47-97.2%) and long-term&nbsp; to 78.5%.&nbsp;  This is probably the result if selecting out patients with subtle forms  on nonmonosymptomatic enuresis.&nbsp; A  tapered withdrawal of Desmopressin is associated with a more prolonged benefit  with 57% having fewer than 2 wets nights per month in those who stopped taking  it abruptly compared with 80% in those who had a gradual reduction (64).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Desmopressin comes in a variety of preparations from intravenous,  nasal drops, nasal spray, oral tablet and most recently a new fast melting oral  preparation (61).&nbsp; Approximately 1% of  orally administered Desmopressin appears in the blood and is biologically  available, compared with 11% of intra-nasal dDAVP (64).&nbsp; The improved bioavailability of the  intra-nasal spray is mitigated by 1) the increased risk of side -effects, of  varying severity from epistaxis to hyponatraemia (63); 2) variability in  absorption and efficacy during intercurrent nasal illnesses such as URTI,  allergy and nasal congestion etc.&nbsp; To  offset the bioavailability of oral administration, tablets tend to have a  ten-fold dose of dDAVP.&nbsp; However there is  evidence of interaction with food in the GI tract affecting bioavailability of  dDAVP and possibly explaining some inconsistency of effect in Desmopressin  responders.&nbsp; The newly released  Desmopressin Melt, presents the dDAVP as an oral lyophilisate that dissolves  immediately in the mouth, without the need for water, making the presentation  more acceptable and palatable to children (61).&nbsp;  The melt formulation as well as more reliable absorption has improved  and predictable bioefficacy - a dose of 60mcgs of melt has the equivalent  biological effect as 100mcgs of tablet.&nbsp;  That said no significant difference in clinical effect between tablets  and sublingual melts has been demonstrated <br>
(63).</p>
  <p>There would appear to be a higher likelihood of success with&nbsp; a longer duration of treatment, e.g. 3  months.&nbsp; Prolonged therapy with  Desmopressin &nbsp;has been shown to be both  efficacious and safe (66).</p>
  <p>Therefore current recommendations for the use of Desmopressin are  that it can be offered to children over 7 years of age and considered for those  between 5 and 7 years.&nbsp; It is appropriate  where a rapid-onset or short term treatment is needed or in those in whom alarm  therapy is either not appropriate (wets &lt; 2nights/week) or who have failed  alarm therapy.&nbsp; It has no role in the  management of isolated daytime wetting but nonmonosymptomatic enuresis is not a  contraindication to its use (in conjunction with management of daytime  symptoms).&nbsp; One should start at a low  dose of either 120mcgs for melt or 200mcgs for tablet and consider doubling the  dose after 2 weeks in non responders.&nbsp;  For those with no response after 4 weeks (at higher dose) consider  stopping, reassessing and alternative or combination therapy (67).&nbsp; Desmopressin should be taken 1 hour before  bed-time in combination with fluid restriction for 2 hours before bedtime and  bladder emptying immediately before retiring (68).&nbsp; </p>

  <p><u>Alarm Therapy</u></p>
  <p>The forerunner of the modern day pad and bell was described by Nye  in 1881 who placed a dry sponge over the urethral meatus and a wet sponge  between the shoulder blades connecting the two by battery.&nbsp; While the urethral sponge was dry the circuit  would not conduct but when dampened with urine will &lsquo;arouse&rsquo; the patient &lsquo;in  the very act.&nbsp; A repetition of a like  experience for a sufficient number of times, I am inclined to think, ought to  cure the patient.&rsquo; (32)&nbsp; The thinking at  that time was that enuresis arose from the bladders &lsquo;undue excitability and  readiness to contract&rsquo; (69).&nbsp; It was to  quell this excitability that Belladonna was prescribed.&nbsp; However the conducive nature of profound  sleep was recognized and hence &lsquo;electricity, being a stimulant (to treat depth  of sleep) as well as a sedative (to treat bladder excitability) appears  suitable for both&rsquo;.&nbsp; It must be remembered  that though the term was coined in the 17th Century by William Gilbert  electricity really took off in the late 18th and early 19th centuries so there  was a lot of applications in medicine including the publication by Erb in 1882  of a <em>Handbook of Electro-Therapeutics</em> which recommended application of electricity both externally and internally to  the urethra! </p>
  <p>Alarm therapy has long been the established first line treatment for  enuresis.&nbsp; Modern day alarms continue to  make use of the electrical conductivity of urine to complete an electrical  circuit and trigger an arousal stimulus - usually audible but recently  vibratory.&nbsp; Traditional alarm systems use  a large pad placed in the bed connected to the alarm box.&nbsp; Recent alterations have developed alarms that  utilize a small conductive strip placed in the patients underwear and connected  to a body worn alarm (e.g. WetAlert, Dri Sleeper Excel, Enurad 400 etc).&nbsp; Some use a combination of sound and vibration  and can be wireless (e.g. Malem Ultimate, PottyMD Wet Stop3 etc).&nbsp; There has always been a large selection of  alarms to choose from with little if any distinguishing features (70).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A recent Cochrane review of the use of alarm therapy in the  treatment of enuresis reviewed 56 studies, involving 3257 children finding that  compared to no treatment, about two thirds of children became dry while using  an alarm (71).&nbsp; For those in whom it  works nearly half remain dry after treatment finishes.&nbsp; They found little evidence to favor one  particular alarm over another but there a suggestion that alarms that woke the  patient directly rather than a parent were more successful.&nbsp; Alarm therapy seems to be more effective with  prolonged use.</p>
  <p>There have been a number of attempts to supplement the success of  alarm therapy varying from additional behavioral modifications such as  retention control training, over-learning, dry bed training, reward systems  (star charts etc.), or punishment systems.&nbsp;  In general this had little if any additional value.&nbsp; The only one with some merit is  over-learning.&nbsp; This requires a patient  who having achieved 14 consecutive dry nights to challenge their bladder by  consuming extra fluids at night and persisting with the alarm therapy until 14  consecutive dry nights are achieved.&nbsp;  Certainly the addition of over-learning reduced the relapse rate, as did  dry bed training.&nbsp; Over-learning was  associated with a reduced relapse rate from 49% to 25% and dry bed training  from 63% to 27%.&nbsp; Dry bed training,  developed in the &lsquo;70s for patients with learning disabilities includes an  intensive program of waking at night and a punitive regimen of &lsquo;cleanliness  training&rsquo; if wetting occurs - this rather onerous and somewhat negative  approach has no more appeal to this author than do alarms that administer an  electric shock.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the greatest problem with alarm therapy is adherence with  the treatment or compliance.&nbsp; The group  from Ghent have demonstrated remarkable compliance, approx. 75%, with  behavioral strategies such as drinking and voiding schedules (72).&nbsp; Factors that they identified as having a  positive impact on compliance with medical management included self-perception  of appearance, feeling less stressed by their condition and a mature attitude  towards problem resolution.&nbsp; Higher drop  out rates (10 - 30% have been reported) from trials have been shown to be  associated with parental intolerance, behavioral problems with the child of a  negative self image.&nbsp; Compliance issues  are not related to side-effects as there are very few if any.&nbsp; The days of &lsquo;buzzer ulcers&rsquo; are long gone  with modern technology.</p>
  <p>Watanabe having exposed EEG evidence of a change in sleep from deep  to light, based on delta-wave changes developed an alarm system based on EEG  which would alert a nurse when sleep pattern changed acutely and then the nurse  would wake the patient to void.&nbsp; The  perceived advantage being that the patient was woken <u>before</u> enuresis occurred.&nbsp; They  demonstrated benefit in 55% and cure in 17% after 5-6 nights of in-hospital  therapy (34).</p>
  <p>What is still not clear is why alarm therapy works.&nbsp; The simplistic approach is to believe that it  works as a form of aversive conditioning, i.e. the patient wakes as bladder  reached fullness to avoid the painful audible stimulus.&nbsp; Others consider it to be a form of operant  conditioning in that the sensation associated with bladder filling become  associated with waking from sleep to void.&nbsp;  However the majority of children who become dry whilst using alarm  therapy do so whilst sleeping through the night without wetting (65%) rather  than waking to void (35%).&nbsp; To further  illustrate our ongoing ignorance of the complexity involved in enuresis,  despite the levels of understanding illustrated by DeGroat, Holstege, Yeung et  al. there was a recent publication by Schulz-Juergensen et al.&nbsp; They found that dDAVP given to enuretic  children increased their Prepulse Startle Inhibition reflex up to the level of  normal controls whereas placebo did not (73).&nbsp;  This evidence of a centrally acting role for Desmopressin as well as its  renal role demonstrates the complex interaction between the central nervous  system and peripheral organs in the pathogenesis of enuresis.</p>
  <p>Current treatment recommendations for the alarm are that it should  be offered as a first line therapy for motivated enuretics that have not responded  to behavioral modification or urotherapy, that wet more than twice a week and  have supportive parents or carers. If there is no sign of improvement after 4  weeks then treatment should be stopped.&nbsp;  Successful treatment should be continued until a minimum of 14  consecutive dry nights have been achieved (67).&nbsp;  Alarm therapy requires a minimum of 6-8 weeks of continuous use to reach  its effect.&nbsp; Patients and families need  to be reviewed fortnightly to maintain motivation and compliance.&nbsp; It is advisable, for some children, that a  parent sleep in the child&rsquo;s room at the start of treatment to help him/her to  wake up immediately when the alarm goes off (54).&nbsp; A video of the Malem alarm in use can be  found at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cst7jPCzAs4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cst7jPCzAs4</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><u>Anti-cholinergic Medication</u></p>
  <p>Anticholinergic medication (Oxybutynin or Tolterodine for example)  have a proven benefit in patients with daytime urinary incontinence secondary  to detrusor overactivity.&nbsp; It has a  similar potential benefit in the treatment of children with nonmonosymptomatic  enuresis and hence may be considered early in the management of those patients  who fail to respond to urotherapy.&nbsp;  However as shown above 28% of enuretics will have urodynamically  demonstrable detrusor overactivity only at night and hence treatment with an  anticholinergic medication at night has good merit.&nbsp; Rather than perform sleep urodynamics in all  enuretics treatment with an anticholinergic is suggested fro those who have  failed or only partially responded to Desmopressin therapy (57).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is recommended that anticholinergics be  used in combination with rather than instead of Desmopressin (67).&nbsp; Prior to initiating anticholinergic therapy  constipation must be excluded/managed and bladder emptying must be assessed to  exclude existing significant post-void residuals as these may well be worsened  (54).&nbsp; A Cochrane review of 2009 failed  to find evidence of benefit of oxybutynin therapy over administration of  placebo (74).&nbsp; However Watanabe&rsquo;s group  in Japan have reported successful outcomes in two thirds of enuretics selected  on the basis of demonstrable nocturnal detrusor overactivity.</p>
  <p>A significant limiting factor with oxybutynin therapy is the high  incidence of side-effects.&nbsp; Theoretically  with a half-life of 8-13 hours immediate relief oxybutynin should not cause  significant side-effects when administered at night however Lovering et al in  1988 found no benefit in 30 children and found minor side effects (stomach  discomfort, fatigue, dizziness, headache, dry mouth) in 17% (75).&nbsp; A more detailed discussion of the side  effects and pharmacology of oxybutynin is provided in the chapter on  dysfunctional voiding.</p>
  <p>Given the side-effect profile of oxybutynin,  more M3 muscarinic receptor specific agents such as tolterodine have been  trialed and found to have a role.&nbsp;  Tolterodine initially at a dose of 2mg at night and increased to 4mg  after 1-2 months in the absence of side-effect or benefit may help.&nbsp; Slow release Tolterodine at a dose of 4mg has  been shown to be significantly better than placebo when used in combination  with Desmopressin, resulting in a 66% reduction in propensity for wet nights  (76). </p>
  <p><u>Tricyclic anti-depressants</u></p>
  <p>The use of Imipramine (Tofranil) to treat enuresis was first  described in 1960 (77).&nbsp; Following the  observation of difficulty initiating micturition in adults treated for  depressive illnesses, psychiatrists in Melbourne, Australia trialled a lower  dose in enuretic children.&nbsp; Since then  many differing tricyclics have been used but Imipramine has ben the most  common.&nbsp; They act by inhibiting neuronal  re-uptake of noradrenaline and serotonin, thereby prolonging their effect.&nbsp; They have also been shown to have  anti-cholinergic properties, though it is unlikely they exert their effect in  this way as they are often successful in patients who have previously failed  anticholinergic treatment.&nbsp; Their exact  mechanism of action is unknown with multiple possibilities possibly a  peripherally mediated anti-cholinergic effect and smooth muscle relaxant  effects, due to a centrally-mediated sympathomimetic effect, a central effect  or arousal mechanisms or stimulation of vasopressin release (57).&nbsp; Whatever the mechanism it has been shown in a  systematic review to reduce bedwetting by approx. one night per week and to be  curative in 20% of children (78).&nbsp;  However relapse is common upon stopping the medication and more  worryingly side effects can be severe.</p>
  <p>Tricyclics as well as having anti-cholinergic side-effects are both cardio-  and hepato-toxic and potentially lethal.&nbsp;  Prior to starting treatment an ECG must be obtained to exclude an  abnormal Q-T interval (57). That said the vast majority of side effects  reported from trials of Imipramine were minor with no fatalities.&nbsp; it is extremely important that the drug be  secured safely within the home and the recommended dose not be exceeded to  avoid overdosing.&nbsp; Regular drug holidays  are also recommended (54).&nbsp; Benefit if  seen will be seen within the first 1-2 months.&nbsp;  Treatment should be gradually withdrawn (67).</p>
  <p>A selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor, Reboxetine, has been  used and showed a response in 11 of 61 children with enuresis (79).&nbsp; A further 21 (total 32 or 52%) responded to  the combination of Reboxetine and Desmopressin.</p>
  <p><u>Combination Therapy</u></p>
  <p>In an effort to improve efficacy combination therapy is being  increasingly trialed.&nbsp; Combinations  include Desmopressin with Anticholinergic (Tolterodine), Desmopressin with  Tricyclic (Reboxetine), Desmopressin with Alarm Therapy.&nbsp; All of these combinations have been shown to  be superior to individual therapy alone.&nbsp;  The order of the additional therapy i.e. Desmopressin or alarm first  with alarm or Desmopressin added has no impact on the benefit&nbsp; of combined therapy (80).</p>
  <p><u>Other Drug Therapies</u></p>
  <p>Given the potential involvement of Prostaglandin 2, a known  Vasopressin antagonist, discussed above in the pathogenesis of enuresis,  prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors (Indomethacin and Diclofenac) have been  trialed in enuretic children with limited success reported (81, 82).&nbsp; However a Cochrane review found no benefit  (74).</p>
  <p>The association of enuresis with high solute urine load has inspired  trials of diuretic therapy for refractory enuresis again with some isolated low  level success (83, 84)but none that stood up to the rigors of a Cochrane  review.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><u>Alternative Therapies</u></p>
  <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine has claimed success rates of 76-98% for  reduction in enuretic episodes following acupuncture treatment (85).&nbsp; In this systematic review Bower et al  identified 84 studies that investigated the use of acupuncture in children for  the treatment of enuresis.&nbsp; They found  reported cure rates ranging from 30 -93%.&nbsp;  However the majority of the trials were of poor quality with minimal  randomization and little attempt to minimize bias.&nbsp; When they considered only the 4 &lsquo;best&rsquo;  studies they found acupuncture to be superior to Chinese herbal medicine but  not to standard anti-enuretic western medicine).&nbsp; They report on the application of functional  MRI, which demonstrated a central effect in the hypothalamus and  peri-aqueductual grey matter in response to peripheral stimulation and thus  hypothesize on the potential mechanism of action.</p>
  <p>A Cochrane Review in 2009 looking at complimentary therapies found  weak evidence at best to support the use of Hypnotherapy, Psychotherapy,  Chiropractic, Homeopathy but no evidence that compared these modalities to  conventional treatment (86).&nbsp;  Psychotherapy, Acupuncture, Hypnotherapy and Chiropractic all appeared  to have some slight benefit whilst the patients were receiving treatment but  little evidence of persistent benefit once treatment stopped.</p>
  <p>Some researchers have reported an association between sleep  disturbances secondary to obstructive sleep apnoea and snoring in both adults  and children (87).&nbsp; The theoretical  pathophysiology being an increase in natriuretic peptide.&nbsp; Whilst that paper did reference studies that  reported resolution of enuresis following adeno-tonsillectomy.&nbsp; Many of those were non-randomised and retrospective  studies (52).&nbsp; However a recently  reported prospective controlled trial from New York found no significantly  improved rates of resolution of enuresis in children undergoing tonsillectomy  when compared to enuretic children undergoing other operations (88).</p>
  <p><strong><u>Prognosis</u></strong></p>
  <p>According to Fergusson et al the strongest predictor of outcome was  a a family history enuresis (89).&nbsp; Having  two of more first degree relatives with enuresis was associated with a 1.5 year  delay in becoming dry by night. Similarly and probably for reasons described  above children with developmental delay are slower to achieve nocturnal bladder  control.</p>

  <p><strong><u>Outcome and  Complications</u></strong></p>
  <p>For rather a long time no treatment was felt to be necessary or  indicated as enuresis was regarded as a normal phenomenon, reflecting different  rates of attainment of continence (90).&nbsp;  The oft quoted figure of 15% spontaneous resolution or 1 chance in 6 of  attaining nighttime dryness per annum is attributed to Forsythe and Redmond  (91).&nbsp; Their paper in 1974 reported their  own series of 1129 who had attended an Enuresis Clinic in Belfast from 1952  -1959 and who had not been treated with an electric alarm.&nbsp; From these patients and a review of the  literature at the time they published &lsquo;spontaneous cure&rsquo; rates of 14% between  5-9 years, 16% between 10 and 14 years and 16% for 15-19 years. 3% of patients  were still wetting after 20 years of age.&nbsp;  It must be noted that this study was not confined to monosymptomatic  nocturnal enuretics.&nbsp; Primary enuresis  alone occurred in 629 or 56% of their population.&nbsp; Their conclusions are further weakened by the  fact that these 1129 patients &lsquo;were not cured by drugs or operation&rsquo;;&nbsp; all patients had received treatment with at  least 2 drugs of varying mechanisms of action from atropine like activity  (Belladonna, phenobarbitone, atropine etc), anti-cholinergic activity  (Propantheline), Ephedrine and amphetamine-like activity, sedatives  (Hydroxyzine hydrochloride), diure<img width="280" height="238" src="Nocturnal_enuresis_clip_image002_0002.jpg" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="12">tics (Cyclopenthiazide) as well as psychotherapy, behavioral modification  (lifting etc.).&nbsp; Nevertheless their rates  of resolution were commensurate with others published to that time.</p>
  <p>A large epidemiological questionnaire-based study by CK Yeung&rsquo;s  group in Hong Kong defined prevalence rates for nocturnal enuresis among  children and adolescents (90).&nbsp; A  response rate of 78.6% to the 21,000 questionnaires revealed an overall  prevalence of primary nocturnal enuresis of 3.1% of whom 20.7% also had daytime  urinary incontinence.&nbsp; They very  elegantly demonstrate a marked reduction in the overall incidence of primary  nocturnal enuresis with increasing age.&nbsp;  An overall prevalence rate of 16.1% at 5 years of age had reduced to  10.1% by age 7, 3.14% by age 9 and 2.2% by 19 years of age.&nbsp; There was a marked male preponderance until age  7 and thereafter only a slight bias towards more boys being afflicted.&nbsp; What is not apparent from this study is  whether this resolution is &lsquo;spontaneous&rsquo; or the result of medical/behavioral  intervention.&nbsp; The most interesting data  to emerge from that study revealed that spontaneous resolution probably really  only applies to those who have mild enuretic symptoms i.e. wet &lt;3 night a  week.</p>

<p><strong>Long-term  Outcomes/Adolescent Management</strong></p>
  <p>There have been a number of publications looking at the  psychological and academic impact of enuresis and the ability of treatment to  ameliorate that.&nbsp; Previous reports have  suggested that enuretics did not achieve their full academic potential but that  is reversed following resolution of enuresis.&nbsp;  A recent large population based study in the UK did not find this  however (92).&nbsp; They found an association  between bedwetting and increased reporting of parental concerns re  sadness/depression, attention/activity disorders, conduct disorders,  oppositional behavior and general anxiety.&nbsp;  Unlike previous reports they did not find any evidence of increased  child-reported behavioral issues such as bullying/victimizing, academic  achievement, self-worth or friendships.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Management of nocturnal enuresis is a rewarding art which requires  an enthusiastic doctor who is willing to use a variety of different stratagems  with confidence according to the particular needs of the child and family&rdquo;<br>
