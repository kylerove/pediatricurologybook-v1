    <li><strong>Anterior       urethral valves, diverticula and megalourethra</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>These anomalies, which are confined to males,  are<strong> </strong>eight  times less prevalent than posterior urethral<strong> </strong>valves. In many aspects they constitute a continuum<strong> </strong>of urethral pathology while  also being<strong> </strong>distinct  entities in their own right. It is difficult to define the point at which the  urethral<strong> </strong>dilatation  proximal to anterior urethral valves<strong> </strong>constitutes a diverticulum, and similarly the point<strong> </strong>at which an extensive  diverticulum becomes a<strong> </strong>megalourethra.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><u>Anterior urethral  valves</u><strong><u> </u></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>- Anterior urethral  valves (AUV) are a much less common cause of infravesical obstruction, with as  much potential morbidity as posterior urethral valves. As classically described, these take the form of<strong> </strong>either a  fenestrated diaphragmatic membrane or a<strong> </strong>mucosal cusp arising from the  ventral wall of the<strong> </strong>urethra. Because anterior urethral valves are  occasionally found at the distal end of a diverticulum, it is unknown whether  the anomaly developed primarily as a diverticulum with undermining of the  distal urethra and secondary development of valvular obstruction or early  valvular obstruction that resulted in proximal maldevelopment of the urethra  and spongiosum.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The embryologic origin of anterior  urethral valves is somewhat controversial. It has been suggested that they may  be the result of an aborted attempt of a urethral duplication, failure of  alignment between the proximal and distal urethra resulting in a tissue remnant  that may act as a valve, or congenital cystic dilation of periurethral glands  resulting in a flaplike valve. <strong> </strong><strong> </strong></li>
    <li>These valves may be located anywhere in  the anterior urethra. In 40% of  cases the valve is sited at<strong> </strong>the bulbar urethra, whereas in 30% it is at the<strong> </strong>penoscrotal  junction and in 30% in the penile urethra. They have rarely been  reported in the fossa navicularis.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li>AUV manifest with a wide spectrum of  severity based on the degree of urethral dilation, presence of an associated  diverticulum, and the grade of upper tract dilation. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>The  presentation is with obstructive<strong> </strong>symptoms. These patients commonly have dribbling  of urination, difficulty in voiding, incontinence, hesitancy or urinary retention, poor urinary stream,  and recurrent urinary tract infections. Older children may also have enuresis,  postvoid dribbling, or failure to thrive.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Secondary  changes<strong> </strong>in the upper urinary tracts are rare. However, in the neonatal  period, the obstruction may result in megacystis, bladder rupture, severe  hydroureteronephrosis, azotemia, or urinary ascites. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Micturating<strong> </strong>cystourethrography  is the diagnostic study of choice, as it<strong> </strong>demonstrates the obstruction.  Interestingly, the urethra often appears narrow distal to the valves and  dilated proximally. The valve itself may be visualized as a linear defect along  the ventral wall but also may only be noted as an abrupt change in the caliber  of the urethra. Vesicoureteral reflux has been noted in approximately one-third  of patients, and upper tract dilation noted in one-half.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Endoscopically, the valve appears as a  filmy, ventrally located cusp or flap of tissue. It occasionally has been  described as an iris-like membrane. One must examine the urethra carefully at  the distal end of any urethral diverticulum because retrograde flow of irrigant  may flatten the valve mechanism against the urethral wall. Suprapubic pressure  with the bladder full and irrigation ports on the scope open may demonstrate  the valve mechanism more readily. Furthermore, elevation of the valve with an  endoscopic loop is invaluable in the identification of the lesion.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Treatment  is by endoscopic incision. Transurethral incision of the valve is  effective for most patients, but one must be careful to aggressively incise to  avoid any distal obstructing lip. <strong> </strong></li>
  </ul>
  Endoscopic treatment does leave the patient with a urethral diverticulum  in most cases. An occasional patient with a huge diverticulum and a defect in  the spongiosum may benefit from open repair, which allows reconstruction of the  valve, diverticulum, and investing tissues. In a rare patient with severe renal  disease associated with obstruction, a temporary cutaneous vesicostomy may be  used to allow drainage and improvement in renal function.

    <li><u>Urethral diverticulum</u></li>
    <li>In the more  common wide-mouthed form, usually located in the region of the penoscrotal junction, the distal lip may give rise to  a form of valvular obstruction  as the diverticulum undergoes progressive distension. </li>
    <li>Presentation  is either with obstructive symptoms or with postmicturition dribbling. </li>
    <li>The rarer  saccular lesions have a narrow neck and may occur anywhere along the length of the penile urethra, including in the fossa  navicularis. </li>
    <li>Presentation is with urinary infection &ndash;  rarely associated with stone  formation within the diverticulum. </li>
    <li>Treatment  is by endoscopic incision or resection of the obstructing lip or, rarely, by a perineal approach for the excision of a large  diverticulum. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>C.	Megalourethra<br>
  Is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by abnormal dilatation of the penile urethra in the absence of any evident obstruction. It may be associated with lack of corpus spongiosum or with complete absence of the corpora cavernosa. In such cases the penis amounts to little more than a floppy sac comprised of skin externally and urethral mucosa internally. </p>
  <p>It shares some of the characteristics of a urethral diverticulum but includes more extensive and uniform involvement of the urethra. </p>
  <p>The classification of fusiform and scaphoid types reflects the severity of the defect and the resultant effect on the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosum. <br>
    -	The scaphoid form results from deficiency or absence of the ventral corpora spongiosum. <br>
    -	A fusiform megalourethra also affects the dorsal sponge and corpora cavernosa. <br>
    -	More recently, Adamson and Burge have described a third type with all corpora intact.</p>
  <p>The cause of megalourethra remains somewhat controversial. <br>
    -	Stephens postulated that a delay in cannulization of the distal epithelial core might lead to obstruction and proximal dilation. <br>
    -	Others have suggested that embryologic arrest of the mesoderm investing the urethral folds influences the development of the corpora and erectile tissue.</p>
  <p>Megalourethra is often associated not only with other urorectal anomalies such as imperforate anus, prune-belly syndrome, and urethral valves, but also with varying degrees of uropathy.</p>
  <p>Diagnosis is often  suspected on physical examination, particularly if the child is seen to void.  The urethral meatus may be normally placed but  pathologic. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The rare and more severe fusiform type is  often characterized by a soft, elongated phallus with palpably inadequate corpora. </li>
    <li>Ventral ballooning with voiding is typical  of scaphoid megalourethra. </li>
    <li>Voiding cystourethrography and renal  ultrasonography are performed to establish the diagnosis  and evaluate the upper tracts.&nbsp; </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Treatment centers on  reconstruction of the urethra and corpora spongiosum using common principles of  hypospadias repair. The scaphoid urethra can be opened longitudinally using the better dorsal and  lateral tissue. </p>
  <ol>
  <ul>
    <li>The fusiform variety presents a much more  difficult challenge depending on the amount of corporal tissue present. Some  may be impossible to completely repair from a functional standpoint and benefit  from corporal reconstruction with placement of penile prostheses as adults. </li>
    <li>Uropathy remains a significant problem. </li>

    <li><strong>Abnormalities of cowper's glands and ducts</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cowper's glands are  paired structures found along the posterolateral aspect of the proximal  urethra, located on either side of<strong> </strong>the urethra. The main glands lie within the  urogenital diaphragm, and<strong> </strong>accessory glands are located more distally  along the bulbous urethra. Each gland  is drained by a duct that courses medially and posteriorly through the corpus spongiosum to empty<strong> </strong>side-by-side  in the bulbar urethra. <br>
    Cowper&rsquo;s gland cysts (<em>syringocoeles</em>) </p>
  <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Cysts, possibly developing due to  obstruction of the orifices, may be seen as a filling defect along the floor of  the<strong> </strong>bulbar urethra. </li>
    <li>Distension  of the ducts, or of the glands<strong> </strong>themselves, may cause urethral compression or, if<strong> </strong>the anterior wall of the cyst ruptures into the<strong> </strong>urethra, may result in an obstructive membrane, in a  diverticular structure in that area or retrograde filling of a prominent duct. </li>
    <li>Usually these abnormalities are  asymptomatic, but they may<strong> </strong>cause terminal hematuria, bloody spotting at  the meatus, postvoid dribbling, or obstructive symptoms. </li>
    <li>Most Cowper's duct anomalies are  discovered as minor findings<strong> </strong>on voiding cystourethrography done for  urinary tract infection.</li>
    <li>Surgical treatment is reserved for those  patients who are symptomatic. </li>
    <li>Transurethral  unroofing of a cyst typically is adequate, although one should take care not to<strong> </strong>leave a distal obstructing lip, which may act as a valve. </li>
    <li>Open  resection by a perineal approach has been occasionally performed for a  massively enlarged cyst<strong> </strong>producing obstruction. </li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><strong>Urethral atresia and agenesis</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Urethral atresia and  agenesis must be included in the differential diagnosis of renal anomalies and  bilateral hydronephrosis diagnosed <em>in utero. </em>Unfortunately, unless<strong> </strong>there  is some other egress for the urine to escape the bladder, such as a patent  urachus or an urorectal communication, these lesions are not compatible with  renal<strong> </strong>development. <br>
    Management will  depend on the specific anomaly and the amount of renal function salvaged by  alternative urinary drainage.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An association between urethral atresia  and prune-belly syndrome in females has been recognized, but few reports  discuss the outcome of treatment in these gravely<strong> </strong>ill infants. Most of  these children will come to renal transplant due to severe renal damage that  occurred in the neonatal period. </li>
    <li>In males, progressive catheter dilation  has been used with reasonable success and would be<strong> </strong>similarly affective  in males.</li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="2" type="1">
    <li><strong>Urethral duplications</strong><strong> </strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Another rare set of  urethral anomalies is duplication. </p>
  <ul>
  <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Embryologic  origin: Considering the many different<strong> </strong>anatomic variants, there is  probably no common embryologic pathway to explain all findings of urethral  duplication. Johnson suggested that faulty fusion of the genital ridge and  urethral fold could result in two separate<strong> </strong>channels, and Lowsley  proposed persistence of the urogenital plate during infolding of the genital  ridge as an explanation. </li>
    <li>Anatomy:  Urethral duplication can occur with complete duplication of the phallus or  urinary bladder as a more severe abnormality. Most duplications occur in the  sagittal plane with a single phallus. </li>
    <li>When one  is found above the other in this setting, the ventral one is virtually always  the dominant urethra. </li>
    <li>Woodhouse  and Williams described sagittal duplication with the dominant, ventral urethra  opening in an orthotopic position on the glans beneath a secondary epispadiac  urethra. </li>
    <li>Sagittal  duplication can also occur with the dominant urethra exiting in a hypospadiac  position and the accessory urethra in the orthotopic position.</li>
    <li>Many of  the nondominant dorsal urethras end blindly short of the bladder. If, however,  they do reach the bladder, the child is often incontinent from the accessory  channel.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Classification:  The wide variety of anatomic variations prohibits simple classification and  easy division into specific categories. Simple, unique descriptions of each  lesion as used by Effmann and colleagues based on the plane of duplication, the  dominant urethra, and the<strong> </strong>position of the meatus are useful. </li>

      <li>Types of duplication:</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <p>These rare anomalies may be sagittal or collateral. </p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Of these, the sagittal pattern is more common and takes the form of two channels running one above the other in the sagittal plane, whereas in the  collateral form the  duplicate urethras run side by side. </li>
      <li>The most common sagittal configuration comprises an orthotopic principal urethral channel and an epispadiac accessory urethra lying dorsal to it. </li>
      <li>In some cases both urethras leave the bladder separately and remain separate throughout their length, whereas in other cases the duplicate urethras unite distally to form a single channel. </li>
      <li>In the  so-called &lsquo;spindle&rsquo; variety the urethra separates into two components before reuniting again more distally, whereas in &lsquo;Y&rsquo; duplications, an accessory urethra diverges from the main channel to emerge in the perianal region or the perineum. </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <ol start="3" type="a">
      <li>Presentation: </li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The  dominant, ventral urethra typically has a normal path through the sphincter  mechanisms and remains continent. </li>
      <li>In those  cases associated with an epispadiac meatus, a widened symphysis pubis may be  found, suggesting a relationship to the exstrophy&ndash;epispadias complex. </li>
      <li>In those  patients with sagittal duplication and the dominant urethra in an abnormally  ventral location, the anomaly can be complete or partial, in which case the  urethra bifurcates distal to the bladder neck. </li>
      <li>The  dominant, ventral meatus may be found anywhere along the penile shaft with the  most severe position being that of a meatus located at the anterior anal verge. </li>
      <li>Despite  that very abnormal location, the dominant urethra for urinary flow again is  usually the ventral one, and the dorsal urethra is usually narrowed and  inelastic.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <ol start="4" type="a">
      <li>Management of the urethral duplication: Reconstruction is dependent upon individual        anatomy but        nearly always entails excision of the narrower accessory urethra. </li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <ul>
  <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The  anatomy can usually be well defined on voiding cystourethrography, which allows  preoperative planning for correction. </li>
    <li>Endoscopy  at the time of reconstruction may occasionally be necessary to completely  understand the lesion. </li>
    <li>If the  problem is noted because of minor splitting of the urinary stream during  voiding, repair may not be necessary. Such consideration is typically only  appropriate for those patients with both meatuses immediately adjacent to each  other, and even those patients may benefit from a simple meatoplasty to combine  both openings as one. </li>
    <li>Complexity  of the repair increases as the two openings diverge, especially if the dominant  ventral meatus is very proximal. In that situation, the ventral perineal  urethra usually must be mobilized away from the rectum to a more orthotopic  position and the remainder of the urethra reconstructed with a variety of  urethroplasty techniques. A complete prepuce is useful when present. </li>
    <li>Obviously,  patients should not undergo neonatal circumcision if the anomaly is noted. </li>
    <li>Mucosal  grafts may be necessary in some patients having undergone prior circumcision or  surgery. They also may be necessary for some patients in whom the prepucial  skin is not adequate in length. </li>
    <li>With the  aggressive dissection needed for reconstruction of the ventral urethra,  exposure for excision of the accessory, dorsal urethra is usually good. That  structure may also be anastomosed to the ventral urethra proximally.  Passerine-Glazel and colleagues have described gradual serial dilation of the  dorsal urethra to render it useful for voiding. We would prefer mobilization  and reconstruction of the dominant urethra in most cases.  </li>

      <li>Urethral Duplication in        females: </li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete  duplication of the bladder and urethra is rare and particularly rare in  females. In most cases, duplication of the bladder involves two bladder halves,  each with a full-thickness muscular wall and each with its own associated  urethra. <u></u></li>
      <li>An  accessory urethra in the female is also rarely found communicating with the  urachus. <u></u></li>
      <li>The cause  of the condition is unknown, and the malformation varies so widely from case to  case that it is unlikely that the same embryologic explanation can apply to all  cases.<u></u></li>
      <li>Treatment  is individualized but generally involves preservation of the ureterovesical  attachments with anastomosis of the bladder or urethra as appropriate with  excision of redundant tissue<u></u></li>

    <li><strong>Urethral polyps</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Urethral polyps are another unusual  anomaly of the male urethra. They may be congenital in nature but have also  been reported in adults, suggesting that they can<strong> </strong>be acquired or that  they may slowly grow until large enough to cause symptoms. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>These  fibroendothelial lesions most commonly arise from the verumontanum  and are<strong> </strong>typically covered with transitional epithelium over a  fibromuscular core. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>Small  polyps are usually discovered<strong> </strong>incidentally during the course of endoscopy<strong> </strong>for some unrelated purpose, whereas the larger<strong> </strong>lesions, with a polypoid head floating freely on an<strong> </strong>extended stalk, tend to obtrude through the bladder<strong> </strong>neck to give rise to acute, transient episodes<strong> </strong>of urinary retention. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Other symptoms are straining to void,  urgency and hematuria. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>Frank  urethral<strong> </strong>bleeding  may also occur. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>Diagnosis  is by<strong> </strong>MCU or  cystourethroscopy.<strong> </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Voiding cystourethrography often shows a  filling defect in the urethra<strong> </strong>that may vary in location. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>Diagnostic confirmation is made by cystoscopy.<strong> </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Treatment:</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Most<strong> </strong>polyps can be excised endoscopically (transurethral  excision), although for<strong> </strong>large polyps an open transvesical approach may be<strong> </strong>required.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Urethral       strictures </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Urethral strictures  in children are the result of three etiologic possibilities: congenital,  infectious, or traumatic (iatrogenic or noniatrogenic).<strong> </strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Congenital </li>
    <li>The question as to whether congenital  strictures truly exist has been previously debated. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>The distinction between a congenital and a  type 3 valve can be<strong> </strong>quite  difficult, with the first being just distal to the veru and the latter found in  the membranous urethra. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>The true incidence of congenital stricture  is not known.<strong> </strong>However, if one  defines a stricture as being congenital when there is no known trauma or instrumentation,  almost 14% of strictures found in children fit this classification.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Infectious </li>
    <li>Infectious etiology is a rare cause of  strictures in children due to the generation time for strictures to develop,  often being decades. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Inflammatory etiology should be<strong> </strong>considered different than infectious, and  indwelling catheters play a role in development.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li>Traumatic </li>
    <li>A traumatic event is the single most  important etiologic factor in the development of stricture in children. </li>
    <li>A straddle injury or iatrogenic trauma  following endoscopy,<strong> </strong>traumatic  urethral catheterization, and surgery accounts for most events leading to  stricture. Previous series have shown posthypospadias surgery patients to<strong> </strong>represent the largest group of patients  with iatrogenic stricture.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whether<strong> </strong>congenital or acquired, such strictures are generally<strong> </strong>mild and  respond well to endoscopic urethrotomy.<strong> </strong>Formal urethroplasty is rarely  required.<strong> </strong></p>
  <p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Urethral Stricture in  females:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
  <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Urethral  stricture or stenosis in the female was considered much more common in the past  than currently. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>The  &ldquo;spinning top&rdquo; urethra was initially believed<strong> </strong>to be an indication of distal urethral narrowing or  stenosis, but it is probably more the result of bladder instability and  discoordinate voiding than a true stenosis. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>In the past,<strong> </strong>when a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)  demonstrated urethral narrowing distal to the bladder neck during voiding, it  was assumed that bladder neck obstruction<strong> </strong>was the cause. It was believed that the urethra was  wide because of poststenotic dilation or that habitual voluntary contraction of  the striated sphincter resulted in<strong> </strong>dilation  of the segment of the urethra between the urethral meatus and the bladder neck.  With the following Y-V advancement of the posterior bladder neck, or urethral<strong> </strong>dilation, as many as 50% of patients were  improved. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>The  spinning top urethra probably results from a tendency for<strong> </strong>the female to hold the urine from time to  time during development and normal toilet training. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>The most  recent studies suggest that the spinning top urethra may<strong> </strong>indicate bladder instability in some  girls, but bladder instability in &ldquo;staccato&rdquo; or intermittent voiding with  dysfunction cannot be identified in all girls with an apparent<strong> </strong>dilation of the proximal urethra. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>The  finding of a spinning top urethra on the VCUG should alert the examiner to  functional disorders of the lower urinary tract.<strong> </strong>However, if no instability can be found with a  thorough physical examination and appropriate testing, spinning top urethra  should probably be considered a normal<strong> </strong>variant. <strong> </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>From a  practical standpoint, when evaluating girls with urinary tract infections or  voiding disorders, you should look for the spinning top urethra. If that<strong> </strong>is combined with incomplete voiding or  significant symptoms, the child should initiate biofeedback treatment. <strong> </strong></li>
    <li>There is  rare indication for urethral dilation in the female child today. It is not  known whether urethral dilation is any<strong> </strong>more effective than training for dysfunctional voiding  and it may in fact be harmful.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Meatal stenosis</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Meatal stenosis is a common, usually acquired,  abnormality of the male urethra. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>It is most often found in boys after newborn  circumcision. Irritation of the meatus in<strong> </strong>the months or years following  that procedure may eventually lead to narrowing of the meatus. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>The lesion is usually  identified after toilet training when the urinary<strong> </strong>stream is easier to  observe. The classic sign of meatal stenosis is a very narrow From a practical standpoint, when evaluating girls with  urinary tract infections or voiding disorders, you should look for the spinning  top urethra. If that<strong> </strong>is  combined with incomplete voiding or significant symptoms, the child should  initiate biofeedback treatment. <strong> </strong></li>

  <ul>
    <li>urinary stream that is upwardly deflected. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>In routine cases, not enough obstruction is<strong> </strong>created  to cause renal or bladder effects or urinary tract infection. Some boys have a  history of bloody spotting or intermittent dysuria<strong> </strong>who have responded  well to meatotomy. Anecdotally, occasional boys have had resolution of enuresis  with meatotomy as well.<strong> </strong></li>
    <li>One should be careful not to overdiagnose meatal  stenosis based on the visual appearance of the meatus. Meatal calibration or  simple observation of voiding is typically diagnostic. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>Treatment consists of a meatotomy, which required an  anesthetic procedure. <strong></strong></li>
    <li>Acquired meatal stenosis after surgical reconstruction  of the urethra, particularly following hypospadias repair, can result in much  more<strong> </strong>significant obstruction and sequelae.<strong></strong></li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><strong>Urethritis</strong><strong> </strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>The condition is uncommon but occurs in<strong> </strong>boys aged 6 years and upward, with presenting<strong> </strong>features that include dysuria, penile discomfort and<strong> </strong>urethral discharge or urethral bleeding &ndash; usually<strong> </strong>consisting of no more than spotting on the  underclothes.<strong> </strong><br>
    Attempts to culture a specific organism are<strong> </strong>unrewarding. <br>
    In the absence of other features,<strong> </strong>cystourethroscopy is not indicated, as it rarely<strong> </strong>makes a practical contribution to clinical management.<strong> </strong>However, when urethroscopy is performed,<strong> </strong>the findings are characterised by erythema of the<strong> </strong>anterior and bulbar urethra, with a granular<strong> </strong>appearance and strands of fibrinous exudate. <br>
    There<strong> </strong>is no specific treatment and the  condition is self-limiting,<strong> </strong>although it  sometimes runs a protracted<strong> </strong>course.<strong> </strong><br>
