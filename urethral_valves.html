  <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
Posterior  urethral valves (PUV) remains the most common congenital cause of bladder  outflow obstruction in male neonates.&nbsp;  The majority of cases are suspected prenatally and referred to  specialist centres at birth. Simultaneously, the threshold for investigating  male infants with urinary tract infections has been reduced and therefore early  diagnosis is usually the norm. The spectrum of renal dysfunction and subsequent  functional outcomes vary widely in children with this condition.&nbsp; PUV and its consequences, including renal  dysplasia, upper tract dilatation, vesico-ureteric reflux, urinary tract  infection and bladder dysfunction, accounts for 25 &ndash; 30 % of pediatric renal  transplantations in the UK (UK Transplant Registry).</p>
  <p>This  chapter aims to provide an overview on posterior urethral valves.</p>
  <p><strong>Embryology</strong></p>
  The embryological abnormality giving rise to posterior urethral valves  is thought to represent either an anomalous insertion of the mesonephric duct  into the uro-genital sinus, preventing normal migration of these ducts and  their anterior fusion or a consequence of an abnormality of the cloacal  membrane.&nbsp; Early classification of PUV  was done by Hugh Hampton Young in 1919, which described types I-III based on  post-mortem dissection studies.&nbsp; Later  studies suggested a more uniform appearance to the obstructing posterior  urethral membrane and the prospective assessment of non-instrumented urethras  by Dewan et al1, found similar appearances in all cases studied.  Their endoscopic appraisal revealed the membrane to attach posteriorly, just  distal to the verumontanum. The membrane extended anteriorly and obliquely  beyond the external sphincter with a variable sized aperture located within it,  at the level of the verumontanum and they described the membrane as congenital  obstructing posterior urethral membrane (COPUM).<br>

  <p><strong>Incidence  and Genetic Aspects</strong><br>
The  incidence of posterior urethral valves remains relatively constant, at 1 in  5000 live male births.&nbsp; There have been  no established genetic bases, or potential environmental or maternal factors identified  for this anomaly.&nbsp; Affected neonates do  not tend to have any other system disorder other than the associated renal  dysfunction; however, a higher incidence of cryptorchidism compared to the  normal population has been noted.2&nbsp;  PUV is not included within the range of urinary tract anomalies  associated with VATER or VACTERL groups of children, although a few cases of  PUV in association with ano-rectal malformation have been reported.</p>
  <p><strong>Prenatal  Diagnosis</strong><br>
    The  number of cases of PUV diagnosed prenatally has increased with the increased  utilisation and sensitivity of prenatal anomaly scanning.&nbsp; In the UK, pregnant women are scanned on at  least two occasions during pregnancy. The initial scan is performed around 10&ndash;12  weeks gestation and serves as a dating scan. A second scan is arranged around  20 weeks gestation and this is a detailed anomaly scan. Approximately &frac12;-2/3 of  boys with PUV will be suspected prenatally.&nbsp;  Prenatal findings on ultrasonography in suspected cases may include a  thick walled bladder, the &lsquo;keyhole&rsquo; sign with a dilated bladder and posterior  urethra, unilateral or bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, echobright kidneys and  oligohydramnios. The differential diagnosis includes prune belly syndrome,  urethral atresia, bilateral vesico-ureteric reflux and, less frequently, the  megacystis-microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis disorder. Early prenatal  diagnosis (before 24 weeks gestation), ultrasound evidence of echo-bright renal  parenchyma and reduced amniotic fluid volume have been identified as predictors  of a poor prognosis.</p>
  <p><strong>Prenatal  Intervention</strong><br>
    Prenatal  intervention for lower urinary tract obstruction has been practised for many  years with current options being serial vesicocentesis or vesico-amniotic  shunting.&nbsp; The rationale is that early  decompression of the fetal renal tract will allow improved survival with  preservation of renal function, a reduction in the respiratory compromise and  limb abnormalities seen in association with severe oligohydramnios.&nbsp; However, there remains no clinical consensus  about the efficacy and use of prenatal intervention.</p>
  <p>Experimental  studies have been successful in establishing the link between urine outflow  impairment and renal dysplasia. Similarly, the ability to reverse these changes  on removal of obstruction has also been independently described by Kitagawa3  and Harrison.4 Lung hypoplasia is seen only in association with  oligohydramnios. This and similar experimental evidence has led researchers&rsquo;  attempts to identify the fetuses who may benefit from prenatal intervention.  Further refinement in the identification of the fetus who may benefit from such  intervention has been attempted by analysis of fetal urine, urine osmolality,  sodium and calcium concentration, beta2- microglobulin, and other markers. At  the present time, there is no single marker or combination of fetal urine  markers that is reliable.&nbsp; Serum beta2-  microglobulin can be increased in fetuses with urinary tract anomalies,  including PUV, but when levels in fetuses with lower urinary tract obstruction  were analysed in the context of pre- and post-vesico-amniotic shunting, this  parameter did not reliably predict post-natal renal function.5<br>
  </p>
  <p>The  systematic review and meta-analysis by Clark et al in 2003 aimed to show the  effect of prenatal bladder drainage on perinatal survival in 342 fetuses with  lower urinary tract obstruction.6&nbsp;  Their review was hampered by a lack of high quality evidence, variable  assessment criteria and reporting of outcome measures with the data examined  being from case series (n=147) or controlled studies (n=195).&nbsp; No randomised controlled study was available  for review at that time and this remains the case almost 10 years later.&nbsp; The review concluded that overall perinatal  survival was suggested to improve (OR 8.1; 95%CI 1.2, 52.9; p=0.3) in those  fetuses predicted to have a poor prognosis but not in those fetuses whose  predicted outcome was favourable.&nbsp; In the  survivors, the number with normal renal function was no different between those  who did or did not undergo prenatal intervention. </p>
  <p>Gestational  age at diagnosis (&lt;24 weeks) and oligohydramnios have been found to be  significant predictors of a worse renal outcome.7 However, prenatal  diagnosis, per se, has not led to improved long-term outcomes.</p>
  <p>More recently, an attempt was made to address the  question of benefit of prenatal intervention in the form of vesico-amniotic  shunting in suspected bladder outflow obstruction. The PLUTO trial was  set up as a pan-European multicentre trial.8 Entry into this trial  was based on the uncertainty principle. In the event of doubt of the benefit of  intervention, patients were randomised to vesico-amniotic shunting or no  treatment. Outcome measures included postnatal mortality, renal function  assessed by serum creatinine at age 1 year and any associated morbidity or  complications of the procedure. The trial ran for 5 years but was unable to  recruit the required number of patients and is now closed. Unfortunately, due  to the small number of patients recruited it will not answer the lingering  question of benefit of prenatal intervention in suspected bladder outflow  obstruction. </p>
  <p><strong>Neonatal  Management</strong><br>
    For  those neonates suspected of having PUV prenatally, with no concerns about  amniotic fluid volume, the delivery may take place outside of specialist paediatric  urology centres.&nbsp; The priority is to  drain the bladder and a size 6 Fr urethral catheter should be placed and  antibiotic prophylaxis started, e.g., trimethoprim 2mg/kg.&nbsp; In those neonates where it is not possible to  catheterise urethrally, usually due to either non-availability of a 6 Fr  catheter or a very high bladder neck that precludes successful catheterisation,  a supra-pubic catheter becomes necessary.&nbsp;  Following successful bladder drainage, close attention should be paid to  urine output and electrolyte measurements as these patients may develop  polyuria and/or abnormalities of sodium, potassium and bicarbonate as a result  of excessive renal losses secondary to post-obstructive diuresis.&nbsp; Creatinine should be monitored on a daily  basis until a nadir creatinine level is achieved.&nbsp; For patients with significant renal  dysfunction and electrolyte disturbance, a nephrologist colleague should be  involved from an early stage to optimise renal function and homeostasis.<br>

  <p>In  boys born with a history of oligohydramnios and significant pulmonary  hypoplasia the priority of management is respiratory support and bladder  drainage. Either a urethral or supra-pubic catheter is sufficient to optimise  urinary drainage whilst awaiting homeostasis and respiratory stability.</p>
  <p>Neonates  and infants who were not suspected to have PUV prenatally may present with  urosepsis, obstructive voiding symptoms, a distended bladder or palpable  kidneys and the principles of management are the same.&nbsp; While poor urinary stream is suggestive of  bladder outflow obstruction, the observation of a normal urinary stream does  not exclude the diagnosis.</p>
  <p><strong>Diagnosis  in the Neonatal Period</strong><br>
    Once  the neonate had been stabilised the diagnosis must be confirmed.&nbsp; Renal ultrasound scan (USS) will give information  on the size and quality of the renal parenchyma, degree of  hydroureteronephrosis and assessment of bladder wall thickness.&nbsp; It may also show a dilated posterior  urethra.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Micturating  cystouretrogram (MCUG) will confirm the diagnosis and must include catheter-out  views to demonstrate the calibre of the posterior urethra (Figure 1)</p>
  <p>MCUG demonstrating dilated posterior urethra, open  bladder neck, irregular bladder and bilateral vesico-ureteric reflux. </p>
  <p><img src="posteriorurethral/Figure1..jpg" alt="Figure1" width="517" height="477"></p>
  <p>.&nbsp; Additional information obtained from the MCUG  includes bladder size, bladder irregularity from thickening, trabeculation and  diverticula formation, vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) and the configuration of  the bladder neck.&nbsp; Approximately  50% of neonates with PUV will have VUR. If the VUR has been high grade and  unilateral, a &ldquo;pop-off&rdquo; may have allowed selective dissipation of back  pressure, resulting from urethral obstruction. </p>
  <p>The  VURD (valves unilateral reflux dysplasia) syndrome described by Hoover and  Duckett9 results in very poor or non-function of the kidney on the  refluxing side with a relative sparing of renal function on the contralateral,  non-refluxing side. These authors also postulated that this mechanism of  &lsquo;pop-off&rsquo; results in long-term normal renal function, as the contralateral  kidney is spared and normal. This hypothesis was subsequently challenged by  Cuckow et al who showed with serum creatinine and GFR measurements that renal  function was impaired in cases with VURD, implying that the protection offered  by the &lsquo;pop-off&rsquo; mechanism was not complete.10</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Primary  Valve Resection</strong><br>
  The  procedure of choice for PUV is primary valve ablation which is performed once  the baby is stable from a medical point of view.&nbsp; At induction of anaesthesia a dose of intravenous  antibiotic is given, e.g., co-amoxiclav 30mg/kg.&nbsp; The baby is placed in the lithotomy position  and a diagnostic cystoscopy using 0&deg; 6/8 Fr neonatal cystoscope<strong> </strong>performed.&nbsp; The posterior urethra should be carefully  inspected and the valve configuration noted.&nbsp;  The configuration of the bladder neck and appearances of the bladder and  ureteric orifices should also be noted.&nbsp;  The 11 Fr resectoscope is assembled with either the cold/sickle blade or  bugbee electrode and valve resection is typically performed at the 5, 7 and 12  o&rsquo;clock positions (Figure 2).</p>
  <p>Endoscopic view of PUV with  the sites for valve incision marked.<br>
  <img src="posteriorurethral/fugure2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="526" height="477"></p>
  <p>&nbsp; A urethral  catheter is placed at the end of the procedure and removed 24-48 hours  later.&nbsp; The creatinine should be checked  following catheter removal and the nappies weighed to document urine  output.&nbsp; Antibiotic prophylaxis and renal  supplements should continue until further review.</p>
  <p>The  complications of primary valve ablation include bleeding, incomplete valve resection,  urethral stricture or inadvertent damage to the external sphincter.&nbsp; The choice of technique is dictated by the  instruments available, calibre of the neonatal urethra and the size and  maturity of the baby.</p>
  <p>For  preterm or very small neonates, endoscopic resection is delayed due to the  difficulties of the small calibre of the urethra and potential complications of  using the relatively larger instruments.&nbsp;  These children may be managed with a urethral or supra-pubic catheter  until such time as they are big enough for the procedure. As a guide, a body  weight of 2.5 kg should allow safe and accurate PUV resection with standard  endoscopic instruments. </p>
  <p>For  some small neonates there may be repeated issues with urethral or suprapubic  catheters falling out, becoming blocked or dislodged or not draining adequately  and in these circumstances formation of a vesicostomy may be considered the  safest option to ensure adequate and continuous bladder drainage. </p>
  <p>It is our recommendation that all boys have a follow-up cystoscopy  within 3 months of the primary procedure to ensure completeness of valve  ablation.&nbsp; This is due to the poor  correlation of repeat MCUG in diagnosing residual valve leaflets and  cystoscopic appraisal of residual valve leaflets requiring further resection;  positive predictive valve 56%.11 However, some centres would choose  to perform a repeat MCUG at this stage and proceed to cystoscopy  only if the MCUG suggests persisting urethral obstruction. A further advantage  of proceeding directly to check cystoscopy is that it provides an opportunity  to perform circumcision which has been shown to reduce the rate of urinary  tract infection by at least 83% in boys with posterior urethral valves.12</p>
  <p><strong>Presentation,  Diagnosis and Management in the Older Child</strong><br>
A  smaller number of patients with PUV will not present as neonates or infants but  attend clinics in childhood or early adolescence with symptoms of diurnal  enuresis, dribbling or poor urine stream, infection or less commonly hematuria.&nbsp; A careful voiding history may suggest the  diagnosis and non-invasive studies, such as flow rates and measurement of  post-void residual volumes, may also point to the abnormality.&nbsp; Urethral catheterisation in the older child  is invasive and fraught with difficulties; therefore, our preference is to omit  the MCUG and instead, proceed directly to a diagnostic cystoscopy and primary  valve ablation if the diagnosis is confirmed.&nbsp;  Follow-up after successful complete valve ablation is as outlined below  with a greater suspicion of persistent bladder dysfunction in those presenting  late.</p>
  <p><strong>Follow-up</strong><br>
    Each  institution will have a different follow-up regimen for children with posterior  urethral valves.&nbsp; However, the principles  of follow-up are universal with the objectives being to maximise renal  function, minimise urinary infections and renal scarring, assessment and  management of voiding dysfunction with the aim of attaining total urinary  continence and eventually arrange transition to adolescent and adult services.&nbsp; The involvement of pediatric nephrology is  imperative to maximise outcomes and to ensure the correct medical management of  these children (Table 1).</p>

  <p><strong>Early  Urinary Diversion</strong><br>
    There  is a small group of boys in whom the standard measures outlined above do not  produce the desired outcome and their renal function remains fragile or  deteriorates, they suffer recurrent urinary tract infections or there is  significant deterioration in the appearance of the upper tracts or bladder  emptying is incomplete on serial ultrasounds.&nbsp;  The aim in these children is to maximise their renal potential and to  delay or avoid renal replacement.&nbsp; Early  urinary diversion, either by vesicostomy or bilateral ureterostomy or  pyelostomy, aims to protect the upper tracts and minimise the risks of  infection.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Early  diversion with the Sober ureterostomy at the time of primary valve ablation, or  shortly afterwards by Ghanem and Nijman, was reported as allowing for an  improvement in serum creatinine in 21 patients.13 Tietjen et al  carried out supra-vesical diversions in 26 patients and reported that this did  not offer an improvement in the outcome of renal function in the long-term.14&nbsp; However, Lopez-Pereira at al found that in 24  boys with renal impairment at the time of diagnosis treated with  pyelo-ureterostomy, the glomerular filtration rate at 1 year of age was  improved in the diverted group but by age 5 years this improvement was no  longer evident.15</p>
  <p>A  recent development is the use of a refluxing ureterostomy as a form of urinary  diversion. This is an elegant technique; it allows bladder cycling to continue  and at the same time dissipates the high storage and voiding pressures that are  present in the valve bladder at this age. The primary requirement is a freely  refluxing ureter and the procedure is carried out through a low groin skin  crease incision. The ureter is identified and isolated extra-vesically in the  retroperitoneum. A loop refluxing ureterostomy is then fashioned and will drain  into the nappy. Unlike the end ureterostomy, reversal is relatively easy.&nbsp; Once the procedure has served its purpose or  stops refluxing, the ureterostomy is simply closed and the ureter returned to  the retroperitoneal space. The refluxing ureterostomy is particularly useful in  boys with fragile renal function, as it will minimise the potential detrimental  effects of the high-pressure bladder that is present in the early period  following valve ablation. This is critical in the management of these neonates  as renal replacement in infancy is extremely precarious and difficult to maintain.</p>
  <p>There  have been legitimate concerns that bypassing the bladder or having a  continuously empty bladder may negatively impact future bladder function. Additionally,  there is a lack of convincing evidence that urinary diversion improves  long-term renal function.</p>
  <p>When comparing primary valve ablation with primary vesicostomy, Godbole  et al found no significant difference in serum creatinine and glomerular  filtration rate (GFR) at 1 year of age between the two groups.16&nbsp; The group who had vesicostomy formation as  their primary procedure had been diverted for a median time of 18 months and 7  boys who had subsequent urodynamics demonstrated a normal bladder  capacity.&nbsp; Jaureguizar et al compared  bladder function outcomes in boys treated with supravesical diversion with  primary valve ablation alone.17 The mean time for which supravesical  diversion was present was 13 months and all were diverted in the first 2 months  of life. They carried out invasive urodynamic studies at age 9&ndash;10 years and  found very similar proportions of normal, poorly compliant, unstable and  failing bladders in both groups. </p>
  <p>More  favourable bladder outcomes, improved capacity, lower detrusor end-fill  pressure at expected bladder capacity, and less frequent detrusor instability  have been demonstrated in 8 patients managed with primary valve ablation  compared to 11 boys managed with high and low loop ureterostomy.18&nbsp; The urodynamic studies were performed in  these boys at a minimal mean age of 11 years and the duration of diversion was  a mean of 57 months.</p>
  <p>Thus,  the place of early urinary diversion in the management of boys with PUV is  limited. It has the potential to improve renal function in the short-term which  is very important in boys with fragile kidney function and can defer renal replacement  to a later stage. There is no convincing evidence to support its role as a way  of improving long-term renal function and the jury is out on its effect on  long-term bladder function. Therefore, urinary diversion must be considered in  selected cases with clear goals and endpoints in mind, and has an important  place in the management of boys with PUV.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Long-term  Outcomes: the Upper Urinary Tract</strong><br>
    Urine  production begins at 8-9 weeks gestation and the collecting system is formed by  the end of the first trimester. The fetal bladder can be seen soon after this  on prenatal ultrasound. The presence of bladder outflow obstruction transmits  raised intraluminal pressure to the developing renal parenchyma and once a  critical level is reached causes apoptosis, abnormal cellular differentiation  and glomerular changes that occur within the kidney. These early changes  dictate the functional renal potential in later life.&nbsp; In cases where the obstruction is less severe  or declares itself later in pregnancy, the effects of obstruction tend to be  more on the bladder and renal effects are limited to dilatation of the  collecting system with minimal disruption of normal nephrogenesis.&nbsp; An alternative or perhaps supplementary  theory to explain the renal dysplasia seen in conjunction with posterior  urethral valves relates to abnormal position of the ureteric bud and  implantation into the metanephric blastema.19&nbsp; Renal dysfunction thus appears to be the  result of varying degrees of inherent dysplasia and the effects of bladder  outflow obstruction. In post-natal life these effects can be further  exaggerated by urinary tract infections, VUR and bladder dysfunction</p>
  <p>When  there is a significant loss of nephrons, hyperfiltration of existing functional  nephrons occurs via vasodilatation of the afferent arterioles. The resultant  glomerular capillary hypertension allows for normal renal function to be  temporarily maintained.&nbsp; Over time this  compensatory mechanism decompensates, glomerulosclerosis ensues, with resulting  proteinuria, hypertension and a reduced glomerular filtration rate.&nbsp; Damage to the distal nephron impairs the  concentrating ability of the kidney resulting in polyuria and polydipsia  (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), which can worsen bladder function and thereby  further risk upper tract function. </p>
  <p>The  paper by Parkhouse et al is often quoted and describes the long-term outcomes  of 98 boys diagnosed with posterior urethral valves presenting between  1966-1975, before the era of antenatal diagnosis.20 The follow-up  period of this study ranged from 11 to 22 years. 66% of the cohort presented in  the first year of life and half of the cohort of patients were managed with  primary valve ablation, the remainder being diverted.&nbsp; 32% (31 patients) had a &lsquo;bad long-term renal  outcome;&rsquo; 10 patients died of acute renal failure, 15 developed end-stage renal  disease and 6 had established chronic renal impairment over the follow-up  period.&nbsp; Presentation under the age of  one year (p&lt;0.05), presence of bilateral vesico-ureteric reflux (p&lt;0.0010),  a plasma urea on initial discharge of &gt;10 mmol/litre, and at age 5 years,  presence of proteinuria (p&lt;0.001) along with persistent urinary incontinence  were all associated with a poor renal outcome.</p>
  <p>More  contemporary series report rather similar results.&nbsp; Kousidis et al reported a series of 42  patients with pre and postnatally diagnosed posterior urethral valves between  1984-1996.21&nbsp; The follow-up  period was 10-23 years. There were 3 (7%) deaths (2 in the neonatal period and  1 patient age 3 years following unsuccessful transplantation), 11 patients (26  %) had progressed to end-stage renal failure, one of these occurring only in  the late teenage years.</p>
  <p>In a group of 65 PUV patients  presenting during 1987-2004 and followed over a shorter time period (range  1-14.3 years; median follow-up 6.8 years), Sarhan et al found a 17%  overall rate of renal impairment of whom 9% had progressed to ESRF.7&nbsp; Early gestational age at diagnosis (&lt;24  weeks; p=0.003) and pre-natal oligohydramnios or anhydramnios (p=0.02) was associated  with a poor outcome. There were no deaths in this group but during the same  study period there were 14 fetuses with a prenatal diagnosis in which the  pregnancy was terminated.&nbsp; Fetal urine  analysis had been done in all cases and post mortem findings confirmed severe  renal histological changes. This suggests that the overall incidence of renal  failure, if taking into account the fetuses that were terminated, is similar to  the other studies above.</p>
  <p>DeFoor&rsquo;s  larger group of 119 PUV patients followed for a similar length of time, (range  3-24 years; mean follow-up 7.2 years), found 13% to have developed end stage  renal failure by a median age of 8.2 years (range 7 days- 17.5 years).22  In this study, bladder dysfunction, necessitating clean intermittent catheterisation  and/or use of anti-cholinergics, was associated with an increased risk of  ESRF.&nbsp; Nadir serum creatinine &gt; 1.0  mg/dl was also associated with an increased risk of ESRF (OR 71, CI 10-482) and  this has been borne out in several previous and subsequent studies where serum  creatinine &lt;1.0 mg/dl at 1 year of age affords a good long-term renal  outcome. </p>
  <p>Heikkila  et al have evaluated a larger cohort of patients (n=193) with posterior  urethral valves over a much longer period of time (range 6-69 years; median  follow-up 31 years).23&nbsp; The  rate of progression to end stage renal failure was 22.8%, with 68% developing  ESRF before the age of 17 years and the remainder after the age of 17  years.&nbsp; The deterioration in renal  function around the time of puberty in children with dysplastic kidneys is well  recognised24 and a likely explanation is that it represents changes  within the kidney in response to growth, increased body mass and increased  blood pressure.&nbsp; However, this late  deterioration in renal function after puberty highlighted by this paper  highlights the need for follow-up of these patients into adulthood and beyond.</p>
  <p><strong>Vesico-ureteric Reflux:&nbsp; </strong>At  presentation, approximately 50% of patients have vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR)  on the initial MCUG.&nbsp; This is believed to  be secondary to the bladder outflow obstruction and co-existent bladder  dysfunction.&nbsp; Approximately 15% of  patients will demonstrate unilateral high grade VUR with non-function of the  ipsilateral kidney.&nbsp; Following valve  ablation the severity of VUR may decrease or resolve completely in 25-50% of  cases, and this improvement is more likely in those presenting as neonates or  during infancy.&nbsp; Persistent VUR,  especially high grade and bilateral, after successful valve ablation is  associated with poor long-term renal outcome and is one of the poor prognostic  indicators identified by Parkhouse et al.20 There is no longer the  trend to perform anti-reflux procedures in boys with PUV, as failure rates  associated with this approach are high. In cases where the grade of reflux is  high and associated with poor function in the ipsilateral kidney, the capacious  ureter has been used to augment the bladder in association with removal of the  non-functioning kidney. Other innovative strategies include creating a refluxing  ureterostomy as previously discussed and occasionally the distal ureter has  been used as a Mitrofanoff channel with or without an associated anti-reflux  procedure. Persistent higher grades of reflux are a potential risk factor for  recurrent urinary infection and can impact negatively on transplanted kidneys  and are therefore usually treated surgically prior to renal transplantation.</p>
  <p><strong>Hydro-ureteronephrosis: </strong>The majority of neonates presenting  with posterior urethral valves will demonstrate bilateral  hydro-ureteronephrosis.&nbsp; This is often  seen to improve with initial catheterisation but may temporarily worsen due to  functional obstruction at the level of the VUJ by the thickened bladder wall  that collapses, pinching off the ureteric orifices following catheterisation  and decompression.&nbsp; It is important to  recognise this phenomenon and occasionally this can result in anuria that lasts  for 24-48 hours. The obstruction spontaneously resolves within 48-72 hours and  is usually followed by post-obstructive diuresis. It is important to keep a  steady nerve and resist the temptation to try and decompress the upper tracts  with either internal JJ stenting or placement of nephrostomies. After primary  valve ablation one should anticipate the degree of upper tract dilatation to  gradually improve or resolve altogether.25 This improvement will be  influenced by ongoing VUR, bladder dysfunction, polyuria and abnormal ureteric  motility and all these factors must be accounted for when assessing outcomes  following valve ablation. Ureteric re-implantation with or without tapering is  no longer performed in the context of worsening hydro-ureteronephrosis in cases  of PUV as the role of the bladder and its associated dysfunction and renal  tubular dysfunction with resultant polyuria have become increasingly recognised  with improved understanding of the pathophysiology of bladder outflow  obstruction.</p>
  <p><strong>Long-term  Outcomes: the Lower Urinary Tract</strong><br>
The  underlying aetiology of bladder behaviour in posterior urethral valves remains  a topic of much debate. The two main culprits implicated in the aetiology are  that the abnormal bladder is the result of in-utero changes in response to  outflow obstruction and/or that the bladder dysfunction is the result of  urinary diversion.&nbsp; The jury is out on  the second theory, as currently, the majority of cases are not diverted  although the incidence of bladder dysfunction remains high. In addition Godbole  et al16 have shown that diversion is not necessarily detrimental to  outcome of bladder function and may even improve it. </p>
  <p>Histologically,  the obstructed bladder in fetal animal models demonstrates an increase in  smooth muscle mass, an increase in the number of muscarinic receptors and  increased collagen deposition.&nbsp; Levin et  al have shown the bladder to pass through three phases in response to  obstruction.26 Researchers have also demonstrated reversibility in  some of these changes with removal of obstruction although recovery may be  partial depending on the timing of reversal and the degree of irreversible  damage that has already occurred. The early presentation that results from  prenatal diagnosis allows for prompt treatment and therefore it would be  reasonable to expect improved outcomes for bladder function in the current  population of boys with prenatally suspected bladder outflow obstruction.<br>
    The term &lsquo;valve bladder syndrome&rsquo; was  introduced as a concept in the 1980s to encompass the abnormal voiding patterns  and symptoms of voiding dysfunction, the persistent thick walled bladder,  incomplete bladder emptying and associated upper tract dilatation seen in many  boys with posterior urethral valves.&nbsp;  Peters et al, in their cohort of 41 boys who were evaluated mainly for  persistent urinary incontinence and &lsquo;valve bladder syndrome,&rsquo; found three  dominant urodynamic patterns on invasive testing; the hyper-reflexic bladder,  hypo-compliant or acontractile bladder with some overlap between these  patterns.27</p>
  <p>Over  the last 30 years clinicians have begun to recognise and understand the  importance of bladder dysfunction and its impact outcome of both urinary  continence and renal function in boys with posterior urethral valves. Marked  differences in the technique of urodynamics, classification of different  patterns and timing of examinations are seen when reviewing the literature on  this topic.</p>
  <p>Holmdahl  et al followed 12 boys with PUV under the age of 15 years.&nbsp; Instability during urodynamic filling was  observed in 2/3 of patients at 5 years of age but by puberty this had reduced.28&nbsp; Bladder capacity at age 5 years appeared to  be normal but after puberty capacity was shown to be approximately twice  expected capacity.&nbsp; The urodynamic  pattern changed over time with instability decreasing in favour of an over  distended pattern with increasing age.&nbsp;  This change in bladder behaviour was also shown by De Gennaro et al,  where 71% of 48 patients studied had abnormal urodynamic studies between ages  10 months-15 years.29&nbsp; In the  age group &lt;8 years, 44% had hypercontractile and 31% hypocontractile  bladders and patients &gt;8 years demonstrated 28 % hypercontractile and 50%  hypocontractile urodynamic patterns.&nbsp;  Misseri et al demonstrated a lower rate (5.9%) of myogenic failure  (acontractile or unable to generate a sustained detrusor contraction for  adequate bladder emptying) in their retrospective study of 51 boys and  concluded that the detrusor failure was due to co-existing anti-cholinergic  treatment in their cohort of cases.30</p>
  <p>Bladder  dysfunction is key to long term renal function outcomes as illustrated in the  long term follow-up study by Parkhouse et al, where the finding of incontinence  at 5 years in 44% of patients, defined as not being dry during the day, was  associated with a poor renal outcome in 46% of this group (p&lt;0.001).20&nbsp; In Ansari&rsquo;s group of 227 boys with posterior  urethral valves, they showed an overall 30% risk of developing chronic kidney  disease with 10% progressing to end stage renal failure.31&nbsp; Severe bladder dysfunction, defined as low  compliance with end filling pressure &gt;40 cm of H20 or post-void residual  volume &gt;30% or underactive detrusor or the need for CIC, was more prevalent  in the patients progressing to ESRF (p&lt;0.0001).&nbsp; Mazen&rsquo;s study of 116 patients with PUV  followed for a mean of 10.3 years (range 18 months-22 years) found 42% of  patients had ESRF or had been transplanted.&nbsp;  Urodynamic abnormalities were observed in 80% of the overall patient  group and bladder instability and poor compliance were correlated with a poor  renal functional outcome (p=0.04).32</p>
  <p>Bladder  function continues to evolve through adolescence and effective bladder  management must continue into adulthood.&nbsp;  Prostatic growth alters the dynamics of bladder outflow and the changing  pattern of bladder dynamics seen in early childhood continues to change through  adolescence with enlarged bladder capacity and large post-void residual volumes  being most prevalent.&nbsp; Some young men may  have to initiate clean intermittent catheterisation to address this  irreversible deterioration in bladder function.</p>
  <p><strong>Renal  Transplantation</strong><br>
With  a significant number of boys with PUV progressing to end-stage renal failure,  the importance of a comprehensive bladder assessment as part of the  pre-transplant work-up cannot be over-emphasised.&nbsp; A high pressure, poorly compliant, low capacity  bladder may put at risk the transplanted kidney and graft loss becomes a real  possibility.&nbsp; Five year graft survival  rates in the PUV population have improved over the last 2 decades from 40% in  the 1980s to near 70% in the 1990s.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>For  those patients who require surgical intervention to achieve a bladder which is  considered a &lsquo;safe&rsquo; receptacle for the transplant there are divided opinions as  to whether this surgery should be performed before or after transplantation.  Performing bladder augmentation with/without a catheterisable conduit prior to  renal transplant allows post-operative healing without immuno-suppression but  risks a &lsquo;dry cystoplasty&rsquo; which must be managed by bladder cycling and lavages  especially if there is no or minimal native urine production.&nbsp; Additional risk with this approach is that  this major surgery may tip the fragile renal function over the edge and  accelerate the need for replacement therapy and temporary dialysis in the  pre-emptive transplant scenario. With pre-transplant bladder augmentation any  additional procedures, including the transplantation itself, must not damage  the vascular pedicle to the augmentation particularly when there is a short  time interval between the procedures and extra care must be taken to ensure the  safety of the reconstructed bladder.&nbsp; For  those patients in whom augmentation cystoplasty is performed after renal  transplantation it is important that immuno-suppression requirements have been  stabilised and the improved renal function offers clear advantages.&nbsp; In this scenario the transplant ureter may be  reimplanted into the native bladder or brought out as a cutaneous ureterostomy.  In the context of posterior urethral valves and renal transplantation it is  crucial that continued surveillance of bladder function continues after  transplantation.&nbsp; Riley et al gives a  comprehensive review of the different strategies of managing the bladder in the  context of lower urinary tract dysfunction and renal transplantation.33</p>
  <p><strong>Fertility</strong><br>
    There  are few studies reporting on fertility and paternity outcomes in men with a  history of posterior urethral valves.&nbsp;  Persisting dilatation of the posterior urethra, damage to tissues around  the verumontanum or secondary urethral strictures resulting from previous  surgery will all influence the efficacy of ejaculation.&nbsp; Erectile dysfunction is seen more commonly in  patients with chronic kidney disease and those on dialysis.&nbsp; In 9 patients with a history of PUV studied  by Woodhouse34, the semen analysis was considered within the normal  range whilst in 6 men who submitted semen for analysis to Lopez Pereira35  2 patients had abnormal forms or high percentage of immotile sperm.<br>

  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Posterior       urethral valves remains the most common cause of neonatal bladder outflow       obstruction in males.</li>
    <li>An       increasing number of cases are diagnosed antenatally but prenatal       intervention does not appear to confer a benefit in the long-term outcome       of renal function.</li>
    <li>Primary       valve ablation is the recommended treatment of choice with diversion being       reserved for specific individual cases.</li>
    <li>A       significant number of boys with PUV will develop chronic kidney disease       and end stage renal failure.</li>
    <li>Structured       follow-up aims to prevent upper tract deterioration, prevent urinary tract       infection, maximise growth and allow surveillance for bladder dysfunction.</li>
