  <p><strong>History</strong><br>
Inguinal  hernia remains one of the most common surgical disorders in children.  Literature for inguinal hernia has spanned more than 20 centuries and with new  techniques there have been new insights into management as well. Inguinal  hernia is a perfect example of a disorder where seemingly a lot has changed  whereas in effect nothing much has changed. As medical students it is often the  first surgical disorder to be demonstrated in ward rounds and which we learn to  examine and diagnose. <br>
Galen  in 176 A.D was the first one to describe the pathogenesis of indirect inguinal  hernia when he described the processus vaginalis as &ldquo;The duct descending to the  testicle is a small offshoot of the great peritoneal sac in the lower abdomen  (processus vaginalis peritonei) [1, Singer, 1956]. First documented surgical  therapy for inguinal hernia was in 5th century A.D. by Susruta from  India- also referred to as Father of Indian Surgery [2]. An accurate  description of inguinal canal anatomy preceded the first successful repair in  early 19th century. Contributions received from Camper, Cooper,  Hesselbach and Scarpa laid the foundations for Bassini and Halsted to propose  sound anatomical repairs [3-8]. Further results were enhanced by promulgation  of antiseptic techniques by Lister which allowed surgeons to proceed with  surgery without worries of wound infection, which was then the bane of all  surgical procedures [9]. <br>
Ferguson  proposed hernia repair by just exposure, dissection, simple high ligation and  removal of the hernia sac, and this was applied successfully to the pediatric  population by Potts et al [10,11]. While in adult hernia repairs, the  underlying principle involved reconstruction of weakened muscles and  aponeurosis in multiple anatomical layers, for pediatric hernia simple  dissection and high ligation of processus at internal ring was found to be  sufficient to provide a long lasting cure to repair indirect inguinal hernia.  The Ferguson principle sans the excision of hernia sac still is the basis of  all pediatric hernia repairs even in the 21st century. With advances  in operating room asepsis, better suture materials and pediatric anesthesia  almost all the indirect hernia repairs have become day surgery procedures. </p>
  <p><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> <br>
    Inguinal  hernia and various types of hydrocele in children result from a patent  processus vaginalis which has failed to obliterate after the descent of testis  through it (Figure 1).</p>

    In contrast to acquired  weakness leading to hernias in adults, indirect inguinal hernias in children  result from an arrest of embryologic development and this also explains the  increased incidence in premature infants. The formation of inguinal hernias in  children is directly linked to descent of the developing gonads. In the developing fetus, the processus  vaginalis is first seen as an outpouching of the peritoneal cavity in the third  month of gestation. Testes develop in the embryologic retroperitoneum near the kidney and  come to lie at the level of the internal ring in the seventh month. The processus vaginalis extends across the  inguinal canal into the scrotum and provides the necessary pathway for the  testis to make its way into scrotum. Once this pathway is laid, a well  orchestrated sequence of events allows the testis to descend to the scrotum  [12].&nbsp; Shortly after descent of testis,  sometime in the first few months of life, most of the processus gradually  obliterates except the terminal portion around testis which persists as the  tunica vaginalis. The tunica normally contains a small amount of fluid and  invests the testis on almost all sides in the scrotum forming an important  covering and a protective layer for the testis. Hydrocele and hernia occurs as  a variation of this theme itself whereby a part of processus vaginalis remains  behind. The calibre of the patent processus determines whether a hernia or a  hydrocele will manifest. A small calibre channel allows only peritoneal fluid  to seep through leading to a communicating hydrocele, while a larger defect  allows intra-abdominal viscera to migrate manifesting as an inguinal hernia. </p>
<p>The precise timing of spontaneous closure of the  processus is not known in the normal population as most of the studies  concerning the rates of patencies at various ages in childhood have been done  at the time of contralateral open or laparoscopic visualisation during routine  hernia repair. According to variable data, 40% of the patent processus vaginalis  close during first few months of life and an additional 20% close by 2 years of  age [13, 14]. As the left testis descends before the right, the right processus  closes later explaining the higher incidence of hernias and patent processus on  the right side. A patent processus has been recognised more and more often with  evolution of laparoscopic techniques for pediatric hernia repairs and has been  theorised to be a potential area for development for hernia [14]. </p>
  <p>The presence  of a patent processus vaginalis is a necessary but not sufficient variable in  developing a congenital indirect inguinal hernia. Put in another way, all  congenital indirect inguinal hernias are preceded by a patent processus  vaginalis, but not all patent processus vaginalis go on to become inguinal  hernias. In recent studies on adults with indirect hernias, the contralateral  processus has been found to be patent in 12-14%, and further, in those with  patent rings only 12-14% have been shown to develop contralateral hernias [15,  16]. Because the overall incidence of indirect inguinal hernias in the  population is approximately 1% to 2% and the incidence of a patent processus  vaginalis is approximately 12% to 14%, clinically appreciable inguinal hernias  should develop in approximately 8% to 12% of patients with a patent processus  vaginalis [17]. These data  imply that all open internal rings and patent processuses do not lead to  clinical hernia. There may be other factors which may influence the development  of clinically evident hernia</p>
  <p><strong>HERNIAS</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Epidemiology</strong><br>
      <strong><em>Incidence,  Age, Sex, Side, Family History</em></strong><br>
    Inguinal  hernia is one of the common disorders in childhood and has been documented to  occur in 0.8-4.4% of the children; the incidence is higher in neonates and  infants [18,19]. The incidence of pediatric inguinal hernia is highest during  the first year of life and then gradually decreases thereafter. One-third of  children undergoing surgery for hernia are less than 6 months of age [15].  Premature infants have an even higher risk of developing inguinal hernia with  reports of incidence of upto 25% [20-22]. <br>
    Incidence  of hernia is 6 times more in boys than girls, and the sex ratio has been  reported to be variously from 3:1 to 10:1 [23]. This is possibly related to  descent of testis through the inguinal canals in males. <br>
    Hernias  are more common on right side with 60% occurring on the right side, 30% on left  side and 10% are bilateral. This distribution does not change with sex as even  in girls a right side predominance is seen [23]. <br>
    Increased  incidence of inguinal hernia has been documented in the second twin once the  first one has been diagnosed to have a hernia. Sisters of an affected girl have  the highest relative risk of 17% while for other siblings, the risk is 4-5%  [24]. Also, there may be a history of inguinal hernia in another member of the  family in 11.5% of the cases [18,24,25].<br>

    <strong>Clinical Features</strong><br>
    <strong><em>Symptoms</em></strong><br>
    Inguinal  hernia is suspected when a child is noticed to have a swelling in inguinal area  or scrotal area (Figure 2). Classically, the hernia swelling is intermittent in  nature, appearing only when intra-abdominal pressure rises, forcing  intra-abdominal contents down the inguinal canal. Commonly this occurs when the  child is coughing, playing or crying. At this stage the hernia is reducible and  there are no other symptoms. Occasionally, in a large hernia, there may be some  dragging sensation or mild heaviness in the scrotal or inguinal area.  Significant pain signifies onset of complications such as incarceration or  strangulation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Examination</em></strong><br>
    Examination  for hernia requires patience and involvement to keep the small child engaged.  It is a good practice to establish a rapport and not to hurry for the  examination. Hands should be warm and the ambient temperature in the room  should not be too low so as to prevent shivering and discomfort.&nbsp; Clinically, in a child with an evident hernia  a smooth soft mass would be seen emerging from external ring which lies cephalad  and lateral to pubic tubercle. This mass would be seen to enlarge when the  child strains, cries or coughs. In case of an uncooperative child or preverbal  age, straining can induced, by one of the many techniques to elicit hernia. The  most common method is to try to straighten the legs as this causes the baby to  strain and may result in hernia becoming evident.<br>
    Many  a times a hernia is suspected on basis of history but cannot be demonstrated on  examination in the outpatient setting. If the history is classical and  referring pediatrician/ physician has seen the swelling and confirmed it to be  a hernia, then surgery can be recommended.&nbsp;  In case of any doubt, it may be wise to call for a second visit or ask  the pediatrician/ physician to confirm whenever possible. Another diagnostic  aid is the so called &ldquo;Silk Glove Sign.&rdquo; Silk glove sign refers to thickening  and silkiness of the spermatic cord which can be palpated as the cord crosses  the pubic tubercle [26]. This indicates presence of hernia sac around the cord  and is a reliable sign especially in a unilateral hernia where the difference  between the two sides may be easy to appreciate.&nbsp; A recent study has documented 91% sensitivity  and more than 97% specificity for silk glove sign to predict presence of hernia  [27].<br>
  &nbsp;On relaxing, the hernia swelling may disappear  or become less prominent or it can be gently reduced by superolateral pressure  towards the internal ring. Sometimes a retractile testis may lie near the  external ring or even in the inguinal canal giving rise to a bulge in the  inguinal region which can be mistaken for a hernia. Therefore, one must  ascertain the position of testis before beginning examination for hernia. If  the testis is retractile, then it should be brought into scrotum and then only  hernia examination should be begun. Secondly, hernias are a part and parcel of  the spectrum of undescended testis and if the testis is undescended, then  orchiopexy will be required concomitantly. <br>
    Another  tool to increase the diagnostic accuracy is use of office ultrasound in  doubtful cases [28-31]. Ultrasound has been shown to differentiate between  patent processus and a hernia reliably in some recent studies. Based on  pre-operative and operative findings in more than 600 children with inguinal  hernias who underwent pre-operative ultrasound, Erez et al reported that a  hypoechoic structure in the inguinal canal measuring more than 6 mm indicates a  hernia while between 4-5 mm indicates a patent processus vaginalis [29].<br>
    A  recent study has explored the use of a suggestive history and digital photographs  taken at home if the hernia is not clinically demonstrable in clinic [32].  Parents were asked to send in digital photographs if the history was suggestive  of an inguinal hernia and children were operated if the photograph was  unequivocal. All the children thus operated were confirmed to have an inguinal  hernia intra-operatively. Though the study was a small one (23 patients),  further consideration in the context of today&rsquo;s digital world is reasonable. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Inguinal  Hernia in Girls</em></strong><br>
Inguinal  hernia predominantly occurs in males, as girls comprise less than 10% of all  reported cases [33]. Clinically, the child would be brought with a history of  inguinal swelling appearing on coughing or crying (Figure 3). Whenever a hernia  is suspected in a girl, it is important to be aware of a potential disorder of  sexual differentiation. Upto 1-2% of all female children with hernia would be  found to have Androgen insensitivity syndrome [34-36]. In such a circumstance,  a testis may be palpable in the inguinal region. In a girl with inguinal  hernia, investigations should be done to rule out Androgen Insensitivity  syndrome if there is any suspicion. Though the incidence is very low, it may  have important medicolegal consequences if CAIS is discovered during surgery  and has not been mentioned pre-operatively [34]. But given the low incidence,  it is important to proceed with investigations thoroughly. The various  investigations include ultrasound and karyotype. Routine screening with  karyotype, though most specific may not be feasible for economic and technical  reasons except when the hernia sac contains palpable gonads. In girls with only  a hernia without a palpable gonad, ultrasound examination from a trained  radiologist may be an adequate screening tool. Unequivocal visualisation of  ovaries with follicles conclusively rules out Androgen insensitivity syndrome.  Only in cases where ovaries are not visualised, karyotype may be required.  Another adjunctive tool can be measurement of vaginal length in girls with  hernias as children with androgen insensitivity syndrome have a shorter vaginal  length [35, 36]. <br>
Commonly,  the contents of the hernia sac are omentum and/ or small bowel. In girls,  ovaries have a propensity to herniate into the sac and undergo incarceration  (Figures 4, 5). If torsion sets in, this may lead to rapid infarction. Once  diagnosed to have an ovary in the sac, surgery should be performed as early as  possible to prevent such an eventuality [33, 37, 38].&nbsp; Sliding hernias are also known to occur in  children where part of the bladder wall or fallopian tubes/ uterus have been  found in the hernia defect [33, 37, 38]. <br>

  <p><strong>SURGICAL PROCEDURE</strong></p>
  <p>Though Ferguson and Czerny were the first ones to  describe high ligation of the sac in pediatric patients, the classic  contemporary description of the repair of indirect inguinal hernias in children  was provided by Potts [10,11]]. High ligation of the sac is a technique which is  practiced globally by all pediatric surgeons and urologists. With time, only  minor changes have occurred, but the basic technique is directly descended from  the procedure taught by Ladd and Gross, the founders of North American  pediatric surgery [39]. <br>
    With the advent of  Laparoscopic techniques, multiple  series have validated the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic approach for  pediatric hernia repair, though the actual benefit over conventional open  approach still remains debatable except in certain special circumstances.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Conventional  Open approach</em></strong><br>
    Surgery  for hydrocele and hernia in children is classically performed via inguinal or  groin crease incision. Inguinal herniotomy is a simple and precise surgery  which can be performed expeditiously provided anatomical orientation is good  and a layer by layer exposure of the structures is completed. Herniotomy can be  performed under caudal epidural analgesia along with sedation or under  inhalational anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway. The child is placed in a  supine position on the table and parts are prepped with an iodophor solution  from epigastrium to midthigh level. The surgeon stands on the side of  hydrocele/ hernia. Lower inguinal skin crease incision is marked centred over  the pulsations of the femoral artery, over the expected internal ring (Figure  6). An incision is made through the dermis until the fatty layer of the  superficial fascia is encountered. In this plane there is a constant vein which  needs to be coagulated as this vessel may be a source of minor bleeding if not  recognised early on. Then membranous layer of the superficial fascia (Scarpa&rsquo;s  fascia) is divided with cutting diathermy and this exposes the external oblique  fascia. A small nick is given in the fascia and this fascia is divided with a  fine scissors along the length of the incision. The edges of the inferior leaf  may be held with fine haemostats and everted; this maneuver opens up the  inguinal canal. Genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve is recognised  coursing along the inferior leaf and this is gently retracted and protected.  Caudal and medial traction is exerted with small fingertip retractors to expose  the course of the spermatic cord. Cremaster fascia is gently separated to  reveal the glistening white processus or hernia sac and this is held with a  hemostat. In case of any difficulty in recognising the cord, a gentle to and  fro pull on the testis will help in delineating the sac better. The sac once  held, is lifted out of the incision and this should be easy to lift out. If  this step is difficult, reassess the anatomy as it may be some other tissue or  some more separation from the surrounding tissues may be required. Sac is  splayed on the index finger of the left hand and tissues are teased off  gradually layer by layer with an atraumatic forceps (Figures 7, 8) This way the  spermatic cord with vessels and vas deferens are separated from the sac. It is  vital not to handle vas during this maneuver as it can be injured very easily  (vide infra). Once the sac is totally dissected clear of the cord, two  hemostats are applied and the sac is divided in between (Figure 9). It is a  good idea to confirm once again before applying the hemostats that no spermatic  cord structure is caught in the sac tissue. After division of the sac, a gentle  traction is kept on the proximal sac by the surgeon and the spermatic chord is  gently held with the help of a gauze piece by the assistant. This allows  splaying of the tissues between the sac and chord so that they can be bluntly  pushed away with an atraumatic forceps. This dissection is continued till  internal ring area is reached. This endpoint is recognised by visualisation of  the extraperitoneal fat or the inferior epigastric vessels. An inspection and  palpation is done to confirm that the sac is empty; in case of any doubt the  sac can be opened by removing the hemostat and looking inside (Figure 10). This  maneuver should be routinely done for all females undergoing hernia repair to  rule out prolapsed ovary/ fallopian tube and also to confirm the presence of  round ligament (Figure 11). Any contents are replaced inside the peritoneal  cavity and the sac may be longitudinally twisted for 2-3 turns (Figure 12).  This allows narrowing of the neck and also provides a slightly tougher tissue  for placing a transfixation suture.&nbsp;  Caution must be exercised as the twist of the sac could evert a  spermatic cord structure inadvertently.&nbsp;  A transfixation suture is passed with a delayed absorbable suture such  as polyglactin or Poliglecaprone to secure the neck of the sac at level of  internal ring. Sac is sectioned about 0.5 cm distal to the transfixation  suture; at this juncture if the dissection has been adequate, the tied sac  would be seen to retract into the depth. Now the attention is paid to the  distal sac which has been held with the hemostat. The distal sac is laid open  with a bipolar diathermy for a short distance to decrease the incidence of  post-operative hydrocele. Hemostasis is ensured and the cord and testis are  reposited back to the scrotum by a gentle pull on the scrotal tissues. This is  again an important step, otherwise the testis can get trapped in the healing  process and result in an iatrogenic ascended testis. <br>
    Tissues  are re-approximated in layers with absorbable sutures and skin is closed in a  subcuticular fashion or a tissue adhesive can be used for approximation. Tissue  adhesives remain popular, but two studies showing that tissue adhesives have no  improved outcome, take more time to use and may have slightly more complication  rate bear mention [40, 41]. Typically a single poliglecaprone suture on a  cutting needle is sufficient for the whole surgery. A small gauze dressing or  skin strips are placed at the end of the procedure.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Special circumstances</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
    <strong><u>Hernias in Premature infants</u></strong><br>
The  preterm babies pose a unique combination of operative and perioperative risks,  which influence the basic algorithm for management. Inguinal hernias are more  common in premature infants, are more frequently bilateral and are prone to  undergo incarceration [19-22]. The recent literature suggests that the risk of  incarceration may not be as great as previously thought. In one prospective study  of 51 premature infants who were observed to watch the natural history of their  patent processus vaginalis and hernias, only 1 (2%) experienced an  incarceration [42]. The hernia sac in premature infants is more fragile than in  older infants and children, and, not surprisingly, the recurrence rate and  complication rate after repair are slightly higher [43].  In addition, premature infants have an added risk of postoperative apnea and  bradycardia [44-47]. This risk decreases as the infant matures.&nbsp; Postoperative apnea  in premature infants after inguinal hernia repair using current anesthetic  techniques is much less common than previously reported. Risk factors appear to  include infants with prior history of apneas, lower gestational age, lower  birth weight, lower weight at time of surgery, and a complicated neonatal  course such as intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary  dysplasia, and requirement for mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen  after birth. Selective use of postoperative ICU  monitoring for high-risk patients could result in significant resource and cost  savings to the health care system [48]. Using regional anesthesia to limit  or eliminate the need for general anesthesia is also a helpful advance. <br>
Balancing  the increased risk of incarceration against the risk of perioperative  complications in premature infants has led to two distinct schools of thoughts:  to repair the hernia before the infant is discharged from the hospital or wait  until they reach enough maturity to decrease the risk of postoperative apnea [44-47].  Premature infants who have symptomatic hernias, who have hernias that are  difficult to reduce or who have families without the means to quickly follow-up  with the surgeon should undergo repair before discharge. Otherwise, there are  no good data to suggest that early repair versus waiting is superior, and both  options should be discussed with the family [17].<br>
<strong><u>Infants</u></strong><br>
&nbsp;In infants, the inguinal canal length is very  short and the internal ring and external ring just lie over each other. As a  result, infant herniotomy can be performed through the external ring without  actually opening the inguinal canal. A small incision just above and slightly  lateral to pubic tubercle may suffice to expose the sac as it exits the  external ring. From there on the procedure is essentially the same as for older  kids.<br>
<strong><u>Large internal ring</u></strong> <br>
In  children with a large sac and a wide open internal ring, sutures can be placed  laterally on the edges of the internal ring to make it smaller after a high  ligation of the sac has been done [49]. <br>
<strong><u>Herniotomy for girls</u></strong><strong> </strong><br>
As  discussed previously, it is important to open the sac and confirm the presence  of round ligament and also rule out fallopian tube, uterus, ovary which may  frequently prolapse into the sac in female children [33,37,38]. If there is no  content, then the sac can be just ligated as usual. If there is a fallopian  tube inside then it should be gently reposited back into the abdomen and sac  ligated distal the tube. The sac can be inverted back into the abdomen and  internal ring closed.<br>
<strong><u>Incarcerated hernia</u></strong><br>
Classically,  the child would present with painful and persistent inguinal swelling (Figure 13). There may be redness and tenderness on  examination. Abdominal distension and signs of intestinal obstruction may set  in if diagnosis is not made early. Unless there is clear peritonitis or bowel  compromise, attempt should be made to manually reduce the incarcerated hernias  by using a technique called taxis. In this technique, with the infant relaxed  (using sedation if necessary), gentle inferolateral pressure is applied to the  incarcerated hernia with some pressure from above to straighten the canal.  Approximately 80% of incarcerated inguinal hernias can be reduced using this  technique [50]. Because of the high rate of early recurrent incarceration, it  is recommended to admit these children and then do the surgery 24 to 48 hours  later after the edema has subsided. Any child with an incarcerated hernia that  cannot be reduced must undergo immediate operative repair. It is important not  to reduce the hernia under anesthesia before the incision in order to inspect  the incarcerated bowel for evidence of strangulation. In girls, an incarcerated  ovary may be present in the hernia sac. If reduction is unsuccessful, there is  a risk of vascular compromise from ovarian torsion occurring in as many as 33%  of cases. Immediate repair can prevent this complication and is recommended by  multiple authorities [38,50, 51]. Lately, laparoscopic approach to incarcerated  hernia has been recommended by various authors and is discussed later (vide  infra). <strong></strong></p>
  <p><strong>COMPLICATIONS OF HERNIOTOMY</strong><br>
The  classical open approach with high ligation of hernia sac has stood the test of  time and is associated with a complication rate of less than 2% [52].</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li><strong>Bleeding </strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Bleeding  due to severing of small veins in superficial fascia may be a minor trouble and  is generally easy to control. Bleeding may also occur secondary to injury to  one of the fragile veins in the pampiniform plexus and can be easily controlled  by pressure or bipolar diathermy. Bleeding from the edges of distal sac may  lead to post-operative haematocele; thus it is important to achieve hemostasis  by coagulating the edges of distal sac with bipolar cautery. Only after an  adequate hemostasis should the testis be replaced back into the scrotum.</p>
  <ol start="2" type="1">
    <li><strong>Wound infection</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Occurs  in less than 2 % of the cases and can be prevented by meticulous asepsis and  hemostasis in operation room [52]. </p>
  <ol start="3" type="1">
    <li><strong>Injury to Ilioinguinal nerve</strong><strong> </strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Injury  to Ilioinguinal nerve is a rare occurrence. This slender nerve runs through the  inguinal canal and upon opening the leaf of external oblique aponeurosis just  runs over the spermatic cord. Careful eversion of the edge along with the nerve  will prevent damage. </p>
  <ol start="4" type="1">
    <li><strong>Injury to vas deferens</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Prepubertal vas deferens is a very delicate structure  and is susceptible to injury during pediatric hernia repairs as it runs along  the hernia sac often invested in soft tissue of the wall of the sac [52-59].  Fortunately, incidence is less than 2% [52, 53]. Vasal injury during pediatric  hernia repairs though rare, has been documented to be the most common etiology  for obstructive azoospermia later on in adulthood and also the most difficult  to repair [56]. Open exploration is associated with an increased risk of  infertility; as many as 40% of infertile males who had bilateral hernia repairs  as children have bilateral obstruction of the vas deferens [58]. Two types of  injuries may occur- ischemic injury or sectioning of the vas. Ischemic injury  results in a long segment of vas becoming fibrosed and is difficult to  recognise during surgery itself. Classically, patients present with obstructive  azoospermia later on in life and may need repair. Second type of vasal injury -  sectioning of the vas is very uncommon in experienced hands, though the risk is  higher in giant hernias of infants. If such an injury is recognised, it should  be documented and surgical repair tried after mid-puberty as pre-pubertal  narrow vasal diameter does not permit successful repair till tanner stage 3 has  passed [56]. Overall, vasal injuries during hernia repairs are associated with  longer vasal defects, impaired blood supply and longer obstructive intervals  frequently resulting in secondary epididymal obstruction [50]. Vas deferens injury can also result in  sperm-agglutinating antibodies which influence fertility [53]. Even minor  inadvertent pinching of the vas or stretching of the cord can result in injury,  which also increases the risk of infertility [54, 55, 61]. This inadvertent  injury may be more likely when there is no true hernia sac present because the  vas is more exposed making a case against routine contralateral exploration in  a unilateral hernia. </p>
  <ol start="5" type="1">
    <li><strong>Testicular atrophy</strong><strong> </strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;Vascular  compromise of testis leading to atrophy occurs in less than 0-3% - 2% of all  hernia repairs [52]. This mostly occurs due to injury/ spasm of testicular  vessels. </p>
  <ol start="6" type="1">
    <li><strong>Iatrogenic ascended testis</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>After  mobilisation of the testis and division of the processus vaginalis, there is a  raw area created which may entrap the testis. To prevent this from happening it  is vital to pull the testis down and reposition it into the scrotum. </p>
  <ol start="7" type="1">
    <li><strong>Post operative Hydrocele</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Post-operative  hydrocele is a common occurrence and represents the continuing secretion of  fluid by the left over distal sac. Most of the times it is a minor collection  and gets resorbed spontaneously over a period of 2-3 weeks. In large hernias,  the incidence may be higher. Therefore, during herniotomy, it is important to  lay the distal sac widely open [62]. This maneuver widens the neck and thus  provides more surface area for the fluid to get resorbed and prevent hydrocele.  Hemostasis should be achieved adequately with preferably bipolar current after  the sac edges have been laid open.</p>
  <ol start="8" type="1">
    <li><strong>Recurrence</strong> </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Factors  that may contribute to recurrence in open inguinal hernia repair in children  include failure to ligate the sac high enough, inadvertent tearing of the sac  (and its extension into the peritoneal cavity), an excessively dilated internal  ring, injury to the floor of the canal (with subsequent development of a direct  inguinal hernia), and the presence of co-morbid conditions (eg, collagen  disorders, malnutrition, or pulmonary disease). The recurrence rate has been  documented to be around 1-3% [52, 63, 64].</p>
  <ol start="9" type="1">
    <li><strong>Metachronous contralateral hernia</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>In 1950&rsquo;s reports appeared about a high  rate of contralateral hernias in children presenting with unilateral hernias  and Rothenberg recommended &lsquo;&lsquo;prophylactic&rsquo;&rsquo; contralateral exploration in all  children [65]. These reports became the basis for the recommendation that all  children undergo a contralateral exploration when a unilateral hernia was  diagnosed. It has become clear now that these &lsquo;&lsquo;hernias&rsquo;&rsquo; were often the patent  processus vaginalis and that, had they been left alone, a majority of them may  not have become clinically significant hernias. The debate about contralateral  exploration involves a choice between treating only obvious hernias (and  dealing with a metachronous hernia later) versus preventing metachronous  hernias by closing any patent processus vaginalis that is found. Ein etal in  one of the largest series of pediatric hernias reported only a 5% metachronous  hernia rate in a follow-up as long as 35 years. Among the risk factors for  developing metachronous contralateral hernias, age less than 18 months, initial  left side and large hernia seem to be significant [66-68]. Still the risk is  not high enough (less than 5% in most series) to mandate a routine  contralateral exploration. After weighing the risks such as real possibility of  vasal injury or testicular atrophy in the light of low risk of contralateral  hernia, most surgeons now believe that routine open contralateral exploration  is not indicated [66-70]. Even in preterm babies if there is a unilateral  clinically evident hernia at presentation, contralateral exploration is no  longer recommended. A close clinical follow-up is advisable though [71].&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><em>Laparoscopic Approach to Pediatric hernias</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
Although  the classic open inguinal hernia repair remains the gold standard for most  pediatric surgeons, laparoscopic repair is increasingly being performed in many  centers across the world. Initial use of laparoscopy in pediatric inguinal  hernia was for diagnostic purposes; primarily to determine contralateral patent  processus vaginalis (CPPV) [72-82]. The diagnostic  efficacy of laparoscopy has been enhanced further by the use of an  ever-expanding range of probes, endoscopic retractors, needles, and other  endoscopic instruments to explore the patency in doubtful cases. Of  these, the transinguinal approach with a 120 degree  scope has  been the most favored as a diagnostic tool [82]. With  a sensitivity of 99.4% and specificity of 99.5%, laparoscopy has proved to be  the gold standard for the detection of CPPV [78-82]. After the initial  enthusiasm in detecting CPPV and repair thereof, recently many reports have  challenged its validity as CPPV may not manifest into a clinical hernia later  [70]. In other words, diagnosing a patent processus and treating it, is not  analogous to treating a hernia.<br>
Therapeutic  use of Laparoscopy in pediatric inguinal hernia was first reported by El-Gohary  in 1997 when he performed laparoscopic repair in girls by successfully everting  the sac into the peritoneal cavity and then using an endoloop [83]. The first  successful laparoscopic repair in boys was reported in 1999 by Montupet [84]. <br>
In  essence, laparoscopic hernia repair in children is an extension of conventional  herniotomy involving fundamentally a high ligation of the indirect hernia sac.  The reported advantages of the laparoscopic approach include the ease of  examining the contralateral internal ring, the avoidance of &lsquo;&lsquo;access&rsquo;&rsquo; damage  to the vas and vessels during mobilization of the cord, decreased operative  time, and an ability to identify unsuspected direct or femoral hernias [85-91].  In a prospective, randomized, single-blind study of 97 patients, the  laparoscopic approach was associated with decreased pain, parental perception  of faster recovery, and parental perception of better wound cosmesis [89]. <br>
Broadly,  laparoscopic hernia repairs in children can be classified into two approaches -  purely intracorporeal ligation and a laparoscopic-assisted extracorporeal  ligation. </p>
  <p><strong>Laparoscopic Intracorporeal repair</strong><br>
    The  first large series of intracorporeal repair was reported by Schier, with  primary closure of the peritoneum lateral to the cord with interrupted sutures  [85]. This technique was then modified by Schier to use a Z-suture closure  rather than interrupted sutures [86]. In girls, in whom injury to the vas  deferens and vessels is not an issue, laparoscopic inversion and ligation [83]  or excision and closure of the sac can be used [92]. Other modifications  include an N-suture instead of a purse-string suture [90] and the &lsquo;&lsquo;flip-flap&rsquo;&rsquo;  hernioplasty, in which two folds of peritoneum are used to cover the inguinal  ring similar to the &lsquo;&lsquo;vest over pants&rsquo;&rsquo; repair [94, 95]. This technique  theoretically has an advantage of allowing the scrotum to drain through the  &lsquo;&lsquo;slit&rsquo;&rsquo; that is created, preventing postoperative hydroceles; however, there  is only short follow-up, and there are no reports of the incidence of  recurrence for this procedure. <br>
  <strong>Laparoscopic-assisted extracorporeal  repair</strong><br>
    In  laparoscopic-assisted extracorporeal closures, a small stab wound is made over  the inguinal ring, and a suture is passed through the abdominal wall behind the  peritoneum. It is then directed around the internal ring, avoiding the vas  deferens and vessels, and passed out the same stab wound. It is tied  extracorporeally under laparoscopic visualization [88, 96-105]. Over the last  few years, the technique has evolved from use of two ports to a single port  laparoscopic repair with an extracorporeal component. In a two port technique,  the variations on the extracorporeal technique have included using an  endoneedle [96,100], Reverdin needle [101], using a &lsquo;&lsquo;Lapher closure,&rsquo;&rsquo; which  consists of a wire on the end of a 19-gauge needle that allows the purse-string  suture to be passed [99] and using an Obwegeser maxillary awl to pass the suture  [88]. These instruments are introduced percutaneously (in the inguinal region)  under laparoscopic guidance and manipulated around the medial or lateral  hemi-circumference of the internal ring extraperitoneally, in sequence, to  place a purse-string around the internal ring. A grasper, placed through a  separate port, is used to manipulate the thread in and out of the hollow of  these needles to form a mattress suture. The two ends of the thread then are  pulled from the operating port, after which the knot is tied extracorporeally  and pushed inside with or without a knot pusher. This technique reduces the  need for the second working port and thus only two ports are required- a camera  port for visualisation and a working port for guiding the needle.<br>
    In  a single port extraperitoneal technique, the technique is similar to that  described earlier, rendering working ports, endoscopic instruments, and most  important, the need for intracorporeal knotting unnecessary. The internal ring  is looped under endoscopic control using a 1-0 or 2-0 absorbable suture swaged  on a large needle (36&ndash;40 mm, curved round body) introduced percutaneously using  a strong conventional needle holder [102-105]. The technique has not been  standardized yet and there is a high risk of collateral damage and also  recurrence if done in inexperienced hands [103,105]. <br>
  <strong>Laparoscopy in incarcerated hernias:</strong><br>
    Schier  in 2006 reported that creation of pneumoperitoneum itself dilates the ring  sufficiently aiding in reduction of the incarcerated contents [106]. In  addition, external compression, forbidden in conventional surgery, is found to  be safe and useful because the contents can be observed from inside. Even  gentle traction with endoscopic instruments is safe under vision and can  facilitate reduction of hernia contents immensely. Further viability of the  incarcerated intestine can be assessed and if contents prove unviable, as a  result of strangulation, they can be excised without adding to the morbidity.  In addition, intracorporeal repair is performed in non-edematous tissue at the  internal ring [106,107]. <br>
  <strong>Rarer forms of hernia (Direct/  femoral or combinations thereof)</strong><br>
    Laparoscopy  has a unique advantage of diagnosing rare hernia forms such as direct or  femoral hernia forms. Also, combinations of these such as pantaloon hernia and  all three hernias (indirect, direct and femoral hernia) have been reported to  occur in the same pediatric patient [87, 108,]. With a magnified view from  inside, the defect can be clearly visualised and the appropriate repair performed.  Repair for a direct or a femoral hernia is different technically from an  indirect inguinal hernia [87, 108]. Direct and femoral hernias are discussed in  more detail below. <br>
  <strong>Laparoscopy in recurrent inguinal  hernia</strong><br>
    For  recurrent hernias after previous open herniotomy, re-operation with the open  method needs to go through the old operation site which in boys almost always  has the vas deferens and testicular vessels embedded in dense fibrous tissue.  The operation is always tedious and possesses the danger of damaging these  important structures. In such a scenario, the laparoscopic approach allows an  approach from the virgin area and helps avoid the previous operation site. So  in effect, technically it may as simple as a fresh laparoscopic hernia repair  and can be done quite expeditiously. <br>
    Also,  laparoscopy accurately identifies the nature of the defect in children with  recurrent groin hernias, detecting unsuspected contralateral indirect, direct,  or femoral hernias in a large number of those undergoing laparoscopy [109-111].</p>
  <p><strong>Complications of laparoscopic hernia  repair</strong></p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Complications secondary to       laparoscopic approach: Laparoscopy, in general, carries its own set of       complications such as air embolism, hypothermia, decreased venous return,       hypercapnia, acidosis, needle/ trocar injury, and gut/vessel injury. These       become less in experienced hands. Pressure should be kept below 10 cm H2O,       especially in infants, to avoid respiratory embarrassment or hypercapnia.       End tidal carbon dioxide monitoring and core body temperature should be       monitored rigorously in all babies. </li>
    <li>Vascular injuries: In addition,       laparoscopic surgery for inguinal hernia has specific complications of       injury to the iliac vessels in the triangle of doom, the inferior       epigastric vessels, and the gonadal vessels for a small number of       patients, as well as trivial bleeding from small peritoneal vessels       [103,105,112,113]. Although small in number, the vascular complications       have the potential to assume sinister proportions, especially when needle       puncture goes unnoticed and the suture is tightened inadvertently,       converting a puncture into a vessel wall tear [105]. </li>
    <li>Post-operative hydrocele: In a       laparoscopic herniotomy, the distal portion of the sac is left intact       without even being split, it has the potential to form a postoperative       hydrocele. And though hydrocele after open surgery is a known       complication, especially in neonates and infants, this complication is       found to be surprisingly less common in laparoscopic surgery. </li>
    <li>Recurrence: The reported recurrence       rate in various series of laparoscopic hernia repairs is 0% &ndash;5%, which is       comparable with that for open repair [84-86, 89-91]. In addition to the       patient volume and level of the surgeon&rsquo;s experience, as with open       repairs, several other factors may contribute to recurrence in       laparoscopic surgery [110,111]. Partial omission of the ring circumference       [102-105], strength and appropriateness of the knot, inclusion of tissues       other than peritoneum in the ligature with a propensity for subsequent       loosening [105], use of absorbable sutures [102,104], and failure to       detect a rarer and direct hernia are some factors suspected as causes for       recurrence [87,108,114]. Schier et al reported a large series of hernia       repairs, and recurrences occurred in 3% [114]. They observed that boys had more recurrences than girls and recurrence rate was lower       with experienced surgeons. During re-laparoscopy they found that most       recurrences occur medially. Thus, the stitches at the medial aspect of the       hernia, close to the vas, seem to be the most crucial ones [114]. This can       be explained by extreme caution and margin which a surgeon intends to       exercise while passing the needle close to vas or epigastric vessels at       the medial side of the internal ring. It seems that even leaving a small       medial gap is enough to invite subsequent widening and hernia recurrence.       It has quite rightly been stated that these cases should be more correctly       called &ldquo;incomplete closures&rdquo; rather than true &ldquo;recurrences&rdquo;. In girls the       surgeon will have no concerns in placing stitches medially. Therefore,       probably, girls have fewer recurrences [114].</li>
    <li>Others: The other known       complications with open surgery such as iatrogenic ascent, tethering of       the testis, inguinodynia, and wound infections are rare with the laparoscopic       approach. Data regarding testicular atrophy and injuries to the vas is yet       not available as long term results have not been studied. Though, it has       been proposed that these may be observed much less frequently in MAS,       supposedly due to less and more precise dissection enabled by       magnification [91]. </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Personal View </strong><br>
    In  our experience, children who undergo open herniotomy for a unilateral hernia  have a very rapid recovery, are discharged within a few hours and are  ambulatory shortly thereafter. Post-operative pain is not much of a concern and  acetaminophen is adequate and no antibiotics are required. A minimally invasive  unilateral hernia repair by laparoscopic approach seems more invasive in terms  of anesthesia and makes a purely extraperitoneal procedure an intraperitoneal  one. Laparoscopy does have a definite advantage in selected circumstances such  as:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Contralateral exploration in       children less than two years of age</li>
    <li>Recurrent hernia</li>
    <li>As an adjunct to laparoscopic       orchidopexy or other concomitant procedure</li>
    <li>Females, where a disorder of       sexual differentiation is to be ruled out</li>
  </ol>
  <p><br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Direct Inguinal hernia</strong><br>
Although  congenital direct inguinal hernias are rare in children, they do occur. In two of the  largest series of inguinal hernias operated by open technique, the incidence of  direct hernia has been less than 1% [52,115].&nbsp;  In the latter series, a third of these had undergone a previous hernia  repair on the same side &quot;for presumed indirect hernia&quot;.&nbsp; In another series of 1600 inguinal hernia  operations, 14 children had direct hernias (0.9%), and half of these were  recurrences [116]. Schier also highlighted the similar fact that due to rarity  of these hernias, they are often missed and end up having recurrence [108,114]. <br>
Intra-corporal view during a laparoscopy may help in a  reaching a correct diagnosis and avoid diagnostic pitfalls and subsequent  recurrence. Classically an &ldquo;indirect hernia&rdquo; defect will be located lateral to  the epigastric vessels, &ldquo;direct hernias&rdquo; defect opens medially to the  epigastric vessels and &ldquo;femoral hernias&rdquo; are those which opened medially to the  femoral vessels and below the inguinal ligament [87]. <br>
The  principles of repair and the techniques include closing the defect in an  anatomical fashion without prosthetic materials. Pediatric tissues have greater  elasticity, and primary repair is usually much more straightforward than in the  adult population [17, 108]. Also, laparoscopic repair with strengthening by the  median umbilical ligament has been reported to be more successful [108]. <br>
Further,  sometimes indirect and direct sacs may coexist, the so called  hernia-en-pantaloon or pantaloon hernia [52,87,108]. Laparoscopy provides a  better elucidation for these rarer hernias and also if the hernia has recurred  after a previous open surgery [87].&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Femoral Hernia</strong> <br>
    Femoral  hernias in children are rare, difficult to diagnose, and require a different  treatment approach than the standard indirect inguinal hernia repair. The  incidence is less than 1% of all hernias as reported in various series [87,  117-124]. These hernias are exceedingly rare in infants, usually presenting in  older children [117, 123]. They often present as recurrent hernias after  inguinal hernia repair, most likely because the surgeon was misled by the  findings of a processus vaginalis at the initial surgery and missed the actual  hernia defect [87, 117-119]. <br>
    As discussed previously (vide supra), laparoscopy may  help in correct diagnosis in most instances, but a surgeon needs to be aware  that these hernias may not be that rare as previously thought and that they may also very rarely  exist in combination with other direct or indirect hernias [87]. <br>
    Femoral  hernia can be repaired by open technique such as the classic McVay repair  [117-119] or by one of the various laparoscopic techniques recently  described.&nbsp; These include laparoscopic  mesh plug or patch repair [120,121], use of the umbilical ligament as a plug  for laparoscopic repair [122] and laparoscopic assisted inversion of the sac  and endoloop closure [124]. Schier recommends a proper dissection of the  peritoneum, exposing the underlying defect and anatomy thoroughly and then  closing the defect with multiple interrupted sutures to avoid recurrences [87]. <br>
  <strong>HYDROCELE</strong><br>
    Hydrocele  is a collection of serous fluid in the tunica vaginalis and may extend up into  a patent processus vaginalis.<br>
    Hydroceles  may be classified as: </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Scrotal</li>
    <li>Inguinoscrotal</li>
    <li>Encysted hydrocele of       cord</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Symptoms:<br>
    Hydroceles  are clinically evident anomalies whereby the child is noted to have enlargement  of the scrotum. Hydrocele is very common in newborn babies occurring in upto  10% of the male babies. <br>
    Examination:  Enlargement of the scrotum is observed on inspection and there may be a loss of  scrotal rugae with larger hydroceles. Most of the hydroceles are confined to  the scrotum but in the inguinoscrotal hydrocele the swelling may be observed  going upto the inguinal region. There is no change in size with the straining,  crying or coughing, except in a communicating hydrocele.<br>
    On  palpation, the testis can be felt separately in most of the cases except in a  very large, tense hydrocele.&nbsp; In a  hydrocele which is limited to the scrotal region the spermatic cord would feel  normal at the root of the scrotum while in the inguinoscrotal hydrocele the  swelling can be palpated proceeding right into the inguinal canal. The swelling  may be felt to be fluctuant, though in a tense hydrocele the fluctuation may be  difficult to elicit. Mostly, hydroceles are non-reducible in nature even if  there is a patent communication with the peritoneal cavity as the communication  is usually small; and works as a ball valve mechanism. Some of the hydroceles  may have a fluctuation in size and may be reducible clinically. In these cases  the differentiation between a hydrocele and a hernia becomes less important as  these are treated the same way as a hernia.</p>
  <p>Trans-illumination  remains the most important test to diagnose a hydrocele and differentiate it  from a hernia. It is a remarkably simple &amp; rapid test and many a mistakes  can be avoided by taking two minutes to perform this test in the out-patient  department. A small pencil torch with a pointed beam is required for this  examination and this should form essential equipment in the office of all  physicians dealing with small children. Hydroceles in children are always  brilliantly transilluminant while hernias do not allow much light transmission;  this difference allows a quick and consistent method to distinguish a hernia  from a hydrocele.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Encysted  hydrocele of the cord is a special type of hydrocele whereby a localized fluid  collection occurs along the spermatic cord anywhere from internal ring to the  testicular upper pole. Such encysted hydroceles are often tense swellings and  due to their predominance in the inguinal region, they may not be amenable for  eliciting transillumination. The key test is to palpate the swelling while  keeping the testis in a slight traction. Then the movement of the swelling is  assessed with respect to the cord structures. In an encysted hydrocele the  movement of the swelling becomes restricted and often it can be felt to slide  down with the cord when the cord is pulled caudad.&nbsp; <br>
Investigations:  In most cases, a good and thorough clinical examination suffices and no further  investigations are required. When in doubt especially, in an encysted hydrocele  of cord, an ultrasound examination may be required to rule out other  differentials such as inguinal lymph node enlargement.&nbsp; Similarly, if transillumination and physical  exam fail to identify the testis, an ultrasound may be considered to rule out  the rare case of a reactive hydrocele in response to an instrascrotal process  such as inflammation, torsion of the appendix testis and neoplasm.</p>
  <p>Management<br>
    A  newborn or infantile asymptomatic (so-called pure) scrotal hydrocele (no  evidence of associated hernia or communication) has a high chance of  spontaneous resolution when the patient reaches 1 to 2 years of age  [52,125-128]. Thus a watchful expectancy should be offered to such boys with a  3-6 monthly review unless the hydrocele is very large and tense or increases  rapidly. On the other hand, a majority of surgeons recommend surgery for a  communicating hydrocele, though from 1996 to 2003 the number of surgeons  electing to wait for surgery increased [64, 128]. A recent report has  challenged this knee jerk operative view by suggesting that even for  communicating hydroceles in infancy, spontaneous resolution rate may be more  than 60% [129]. Out of 110 infants with a communicating hydrocele at  presentation, only 40% required surgery and only 6 progressed to a clinical  hernia. On a short term follow-up, in boys in whom a clinical resolution was  observed, 2 were found to have a hernia later on in follow-up. No episodes of  incarceration were observed, possibly due to small PPV in such cases. A recent  study with limited follow-up, it will be important to observe long term  assessments to determine if any further hernias develop. If indeed this is a  long term resolution, then it deserves to be incorporated into the management  protocol and offered to the patients. <br>
    Ein  in a largest single series of hernias so far suggested that boys with the later  onset of a scrotal hydrocele should be considered to have an accompanying  hernia and offered surgery upfront [52]. Christensen et al though showed that  even in late onset hydrocele, if the clinical history and examination are  suggestive of a non-communicating hydrocele, there is still a reasonable (75%)  chance of spontaneous resolution.&nbsp; A  watchful expectancy of 6-9 months was recommended [130]. <br>
    There  is some debate in the literature about management of encysted hydroceles of the  cord.A majority of physicians recommend surgery for a cord hydrocele  considering it to be consistent with an indirect inguinal hernia even if the  cord hydrocele disappeared before operation [52, 64,128,129]. In our personal  experience, cord hydroceles in infants have a high rate of spontaneous  resolution though it may not be as high as scrotal hydroceles. If a hernia  component is definitively ruled out, waiting until 18 months of age even for encysted  hydroceles of the spermatic cord is reasonable.<br>
  <strong>Surgical Approach to hydroceles</strong><br>
    In  pediatric hydroceles, in most of the cases, a patent processus vaginalis would  be found and would required to be ligated during surgery. So, a standard  surgical approach as for hernia is used for hydroceles in children (vide  supra). <br>
    Upto  10% the processus may found to be obliterated during exploration. In such cases  dissection to look for a PPV through an inguinal incision potentially increases  the risk of cord injury with a subsequent increased risk of testicular atrophy  or reduced fertility [130, 131]. Unfortunately, there are no definite  guidelines or means to identify this non-patency pre-operatively.<br>
    One  aid to identify a PPV during surgery is intraoperative injection of a methylene  blue solution into a hydrocele sac. A PPV is identified as a blue line. Anatomy  of a PPV was better delineated in encysted hydrocele or a in a recurrent case  facilitating dissection and thus minimising the risk of cord damage [130].&nbsp; <br>
    Scrotal approach for a non-communicating hydrocele  was first reported by Belman [132]. Infants with large abdominoscrotal  hydrocele have an obliterated processus and have been seen to do well after a  purely scrotal approach. Inguinal incision in such babies is associated with a  higher risk of damage to cord structures and a higher incidence of a persistent  scrotal component [133,134]. <br>
    Age may also be considered while deciding for the  surgical access. Wilson et al reported that as the age advances the incidence  of a patent processus decreases justifying a pure scrotal approach in boys more  than 12 years of age [135]. Again in this report and accompanying discussion it  was stressed that a good clinical history and examination to confirm a  non-communicating hydrocele is a must before proceeding with a scrotal  approach. Also, once the hydrocele sac is opened, it may be wise to do a  retrograde probing to confirm the absence of PPV.<br>

  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
The pedaitric hernia and hydrocele comprise a  spectrum of scrotal disorders that are commonly encountered in routine  pediatric practice.&nbsp; A clinical history  of the temporal and quantitative nature of the swelling is as important as the  findings on physical exam in differentiating a potential surgical case from one  that may be observed.&nbsp; A clear  understanding of the inguinal anatomy, adequate magnification and experience  will ensure success in the repair of these processes.</p>
