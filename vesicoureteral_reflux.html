  <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vesicoureteral  reflux (VUR) is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters  and possibly up to the kidneys.&nbsp; Reflux  has been linked to an increased risk of pyelonephritis, renal insufficiency and  hypertension, and is cited as the most common cause of end-stage renal disease  in children [1-3].&nbsp; Management of reflux  is aimed at reducing the development of these adverse effects through  maintenance of sterile urine, treating any associated bowel and bladder  dysfunction, and in some cases operative correction of reflux.<br>
Those  managing VUR need to be familiar with several recent controversial issues.&nbsp; Although it appears that reflux management has  improved outcomes for some children such that the incidence of  reflux-associated nephropathy continues to decline, recent urologic literature  suggests that the natural history of VUR does not follow a uniform pathway, and  many children with reflux do not benefit from either diagnosis or treatment [4].  The condition in these children is self-limited and causes no adverse effects;  however, a subset of children will benefit from both diagnosis and treatment.  Clarification of which children constitute this subset remains the greatest  challenge to the advancement of vesicoureteral reflux management.<br>

  <p><strong>BACKGROUND, INCIDENCE AND ETIOLOGY</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VUR occurs in approximately 1-3%  of children and is associated with 7-17% of children with end-stage renal  disease worldwide [5-8]. The goal of VUR treatment is &nbsp;to prevent pyelonephritis and its sequelae  such as renal parenchymal injury, hypertension, and chronic renal  insufficiency. Permanent renal injury resulting from pyelonephritis, manifested  as renal scarring on 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning, may be detectable radiographically during or shortly after an  acute episode of pyelonephritis, but in some cases, as long as 30-40 years have been reported between the first  renal-scarring pyelonephritis and the development of hypertension or end-stage  renal disease [9]. &nbsp;It is not clear if,  in some cases, the poor renal outcome reflects intrinsic congenital dysplastic  parenchymal abnormalities associated with but not caused by VUR, or if delayed  recognition of urinary tract infections (UTI) and/or vesicoureteral reflux played  the primary role [1]. &nbsp;Regardless, the prolonged time between the  apparent initial renal insult and the clinically apparent sequelae underscores  the need for long-term follow-up of patients if we are to identify children who  will benefit from diagnosis and treatment of VUR.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urinary tract infections are common  in children, affecting about 5% of girls and about half as many boys [10]. An  estimated 30-40% of children under the age of 5 who develop urinary tract  infections have VUR upon further evaluation [8,11]. VUR can be categorized as  either primary or secondary. Primary VUR is frequently attributed to an  abnormally short intravesical tunnel at the ureterovesical junction, with  shorter intravesical tunnels being associated with more severe reflux [12].  Secondary VUR develops when abnormal lower urinary tract function and elevated  intravesical pressures lead to retrograde flow of urine&cedil; and is associated with  conditions such as posterior urethral valves, urethral obstruction, or  neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Secondary VUR may also be seen in children with  no anatomic genitourinary or neurologic abnormality, but suffer from bladder  and bowel dysfunction [13]. The patient must be carefully evaluated for  underlying secondary causes of reflux, which, left untreated, may hamper  spontaneous VUR resolution, predispose patients to urinary tract infections,  and increase the risk of renal damage.&nbsp;  This evaluation is important as the most frequent cause of secondary  reflux is likely bowel and bladder dysfunction.<strong></strong><br>
  </p>
  <p>The  International Reflux Study classified VUR along a 5-point scale defined by the  degree of retrograde urine flow and the accompanying distortion of the  pyelocalyceal system (Figure 1) [14]: </p>
  <p><img src="vur/site img/VUR fig 1.jpg" alt="fig 1" width="619" height="613"></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Grade I: reflux into the ureter only</li>
    <li>Grade II: reflux into a non-dilated pyelocalyceal system</li>
    <li>Grade III: dilatation of the collecting system (Figure 2)</li>
    <li>Grade IV: more extensive dilation with blunting of the calyces       and tortuosity of the ureter (Figure 3)</li>
    <li>Grade V: massive dilation of the collecting system and severe       tortuosity of the ureter (Figure 4).<br>

  </ul>
  <p>The severity or grade of VUR has been recognized as the main  factor determining the likelihood of spontaneous reflux resolution and risk of  renal injury. Higher grades of  reflux are associated with decreased spontaneous resolution rates and increased  prevalence of renal scars [10,15].Recently,  additional factors influencing reflux resolution have been identified, which  enable clinicians to refine the estimated likelihood of spontaneous reflux  resolution in patients with radiographically similar VUR.&nbsp; Variables shown to be predictive of reflux  resolution and/or the risk of renal injury include age, gender, laterality,  bladder volume at the onset of reflux, bladder pressure at the onset of reflux,  whether reflux occurs in the filling or voiding phase, presence of renal scars,  presence of voiding dysfunction, and a history of urinary tract infections  [16-23]. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VUR as a factor predisposing to  renal injury due to infection was first recognized in spinal cord injury patients.  After surgical correction, children had fewer problems with pyelonephritis and  urosepsis [24].&nbsp; This association led to the  discovery of VUR as a primary factor in the development of pyelonephritis. Further  studies demonstrated a lower rate of new renal scars developing in children  with primary reflux compared to those with secondary reflux due to neurogenic  bladders or voiding dysfunction [25,26].<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An understanding of the function of  the lower urinary tract in children with VUR is of utmost importance.&nbsp; Children with bowel or bladder dysfunction  not only have a higher incidence of breakthrough infections while on  prophylaxis, they have more renal scarring, a lower spontaneous resolution  rate, and a higher failure rate following surgery than children with &ldquo;normal&rdquo;  elimination habits [1]. Thus, apparent primary VUR in children with neurogenic  or non-neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction may behave similarly to those  children with secondary VUR. Since the probability of reflux resolution or  renal injury with secondary reflux is dependent on the bladder abnormality, it  is now recognized that secondary VUR is more appropriately managed by  addressing the lower urinary tract dysfunction.&nbsp;  Details on the management of the neurogenic or non-neurogenic bladder  dysfunction is beyond the scope of this chapter which focuses on primary  reflux, but practitioners should carefully evaluate children with VUR for  bladder/bowel dysfunction in order to optimize resolution rates, minimize  breakthrough infections, and improve therapeutic outcomes. <br>

  <p><strong>INHERITANCE AND ROLE OF SCREENING</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong inheritance pattern exists  with primary VUR, with up to 80% of identical and 35% of fraternal twins  concordant for presence of VUR [2]. While the exact gene has not been  identified, the mode of transmission is thought to be autosomal dominant with  variable penetrance.&nbsp; Multiple  polymorphisms associated with abnormalities in ureteral budding have been  identified in patients with primary VUR, although no single gene has been found  to predominate [27]. The probability of a non-twin sibling having reflux is  about 25% and the chances of offspring having reflux are approximately 35-50% [28,29].  Interestingly, this relationship is not as strong in children with  dysfunctional elimination [30]. The utility of sibling screening for reflux is  questionable [30,31]; however, one study has noted that renal damage is more  prevalent in screened siblings with VUR and a history of UTI compared to those  without a history of UTI [32]. This finding is consistent with the known  increased risk of renal scars developing in children with febrile UTIs who have  reflux.&nbsp; It remains to be demonstrated whether  detection and management of VUR in an asymptomatic screened sibling will result  in significantly decreased adverse sequelae; therefore, no consensus regarding the  practice of asymptomatic sibling screening for VUR currently exists.&nbsp; Until recently, many practitioners routinely  screened siblings with a voiding cystourethrogram; however, the AUA recently  issued an update to its Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Primary  Vesicoureteral Reflux in Children [33], with a current recommendation that  siblings be screened with a renal-bladder ultrasound (RBUS), with VCUG reserved  for those in whom the RBUS is abnormal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lack of consensus also exists  regarding the need to screen newborns with a history of low-grade prenatal  hydronephrosis for VUR. One study demonstrated that in children with a history  of prenatal hydronephrosis who had persistent Society  for Fetal Urology grade II hydronephrosis after  birth, identification of VUR and use of prophylactic antibiotics significantly reduced  the risk of febrile UTI [34]. Others suggest that routine screening and  treatment of asymptomatic siblings of those with prenatal hydronephrosis  provides little, if any, benefit and is not cost-effective [35,36].&nbsp; These controversies emphasize that  appropriate clinical assessment and management of VUR requires an  individualized approach that considers multiple factors.&nbsp; <br>
Timing of evaluation for possible VUR in  patients with a history of febrile UTI remains a hotly debated topic.&nbsp; In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics  issued a Clinical Practice Guideline based on a meta-analysis of multiple  studies of the evaluation, treatment, and outcome of VUR [37].&nbsp; They concluded that a VCUG may be deferred  until after the second febrile UTI in children aged 2-24 months with a normal  renal ultrasound.&nbsp; This recommendation  was based on data suggesting that the rates of urinary tract infections were  unchanged in patients with VUR prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis compared to  those not prescribed antibiotics.&nbsp;  Further review of this data suggests that the subset of these patients  with grades 3, 4, and 5 VUR do appear to benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis and  therefore some patients with a febrile UTI would benefit from a VCUG after  their first febrile UTI.&nbsp; As discussed  further below, the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics have  been strongly contested by the American Urological Association and the  pediatric urology community, and at present the authors continue to recommend follow-up  radiographic evaluation of children presenting with even a single febrile  urinary tract infection. </p>
  <p><strong>CLINICAL MANAGEMENT</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no universal optimal  management for children with VUR.&nbsp; As  previously noted, multiple anatomic and physiologic variables influence the  likelihood of spontaneous VUR resolution, while extrinsic factors such as  patient and family preferences, medication compliance, social situations and  urinary tract infection rates must also be considered when developing a  management plan for a particular child.&nbsp;  Keeping in mind that the management of VUR should be individualized to  each child after consideration of the multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors  which influence outcome, we discuss the various treatment options below.</p>
  <p><strong>Antibiotic Prophylaxis versus  Operative Intervention</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The daily administration of low-dose  antibiotics in children with VUR is based on the knowledge that spontaneously  resolution rates for primary VUR are very high (even for severe VUR in selected  populations), and that new reflux-associated renal scarring appears to occur  exclusively in the setting of infected urine, particularly in the poles of the  kidneys where the intrarenal collecting system is more likely to have compound  calcyes [38].&nbsp; Thus, maintenance of  sterile urine until spontaneous reflux resolution may avoid the morbidity of  surgery and renal scarring. Operative intervention is generally reserved for  children with breakthrough UTI while on antibiotic prophylaxis, worsening renal  function, or those in whom other considerations favor definitive intervention  over daily antibiotic administration.&nbsp;  Several studies suggest that children on antibiotic prophylaxis without  breakthrough infections or evidence of renal injury can be safely observed  without antibiotic prophylaxis or correction of VUR, once they have reached an  age and developed bowel and bladder habits when urinary tract infections are  less likely [39,40].<br>
    Several large prospective studies have attempted  to address the efficacy of operative intervention versus antibiotic prophylaxis  in children with reflux. These studies have generally shown no significant  difference in renal function or growth, the progression or development of new  scars, or UTIs [10,41-44]. However, pyelonephritic symptoms, including febrile  UTIs, tended to be more common in the medically treated groups [45-47]. In  general, children who ultimately underwent surgical intervention tended to  develop renal scars at an earlier age than those treated medically, but no  significant difference occurred overall with longer follow-up in terms of new  renal scars in those treated with antibiotics compared to operatively [8,48].  These observations suggested that a potential benefit might be a reduction in  pyelonephritis from the antireflux operations for some patients; however, other  researchers suggested that, once renal scarring occurs, the disease tends to  run its course and operative treatment has little benefit [9,49]. One review  concluded that nine reimplantations would be required to prevent one febrile  UTI, with no reduction in the number of children developing any renal damage  [8], again reinforcing the need to better define which children with VUR may  benefit from intervention.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Antibiotic Prophylaxis versus Observation</em></strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many question the need for  antibiotic prophylaxis, suggesting that, in select individuals, the chance for  pyelonephritis and renal damage off prophylactic antibiotics is small  [39,40,45,50]. Between 30% and 50% of children with a UTI will suffer from  recurrent infections and because the diagnosis of reflux often follows a  urinary tract infection, it leads many individuals to the erroneous assumption  that the reflux is responsible for the infection. However, it does not significantly  predispose to urinary tract infections unless it is a high enough grade to induce  significant urinary stasis [40,42]. More often, UTIs are due to predisposing  conditions such as a previous history of urinary tract infections, female  gender, constipation, infrequent voiding, incomplete bladder emptying, and  impaired immunity. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, daily antibiotic  prophylaxis appears to be safe and well tolerated, but it does incur cost and  potential risks. Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections has been  associated with a 24-fold increased risk of&nbsp;  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant <em>Escherichia coli</em> [51]. Other studies have demonstrated the  emergence of other bacteria with high rates of resistance in children receiving  prophylactic antibiotics [52]. While some contend that antibiotic prophylaxis  is effective and safe for preventing urinary tract infections [53], antibiotic  prophylaxis has not been proven to reduce pyelonephritis in all children with  VUR.&nbsp; Interestingly, a 2010 study  suggested that the compliance rate for merely filling the prescription was only  40%, suggesting that many patients placed on antibiotic prophylaxis never  receive the medication [54]. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of randomized studies have attempted  to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in children  with VUR [6,53,55,56]. These studies have generally failed to show a  significant reduction in acute pyelonephritis or renal scars in children with  VUR being treated with antibiotic prophylaxis.&nbsp;  Some studies actually reported an increase in UTIs in children on  antibiotics as well as an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria causing the  UTIs [6,53,55].&nbsp; By subset analysis,  other studies identified younger age and increasing grade of reflux as risk  factors for recurrent febrile UTIs [53,57]. The current RIVUR trial, a National  Institutes of Health-funded multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial  is evaluating whether &nbsp;prophylactic  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is superior to placebo for children aged 2 to 72  months diagnosed with grades I through IV VUR after a first or second UTI [1]. This  large trial of 600 children is expected to confirm the findings of the smaller  studies previously noted.. It is also hoped that subset analysis will identify  characteristics of children at greatest risk for recurrent pyelonephritis and  development of new scars.&nbsp; Unfortunately,  as previously noted, the lag time between development of renal injury and  apparent clinical sequelae of hypertension or renal insufficiency will require  decades of follow-up to characterize the group of children who may truly benefit  from intervention.</p>
  <p><strong>CLINICAL EVALUATION</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Assessment of Reflux: Voiding Cystourethrography and  Nuclear Cystogram</em></strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only tests that routinely detect  reflux reliably are voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and nuclear cystography.  An initial VCUG is an appropriate initial test because it provides better  anatomic details, including the presence or absence of periureteral  diverticula, ureteral duplication, and abnormalities of the lower urinary tract  such as trabeculations or urethral obstruction. It also allows for more precise  grading of reflux than a nuclear cystogram. If a VCUG demonstrates no  significant anatomic abnormalities, nuclear cystography may be performed in  order to limit radiation exposure. Although the nuclear cystogram is frequently  considered a more sensitive test, the ordering practitioner should be aware  that each type of cystogram has limitations to its ability to detect reflux in  a given population [58]. The amount of radiation exposure during a given test  is dependent on multiple factors, including patient size, distance from the  radiation source, and duration of fluoroscopy.&nbsp;  The American Radiological Association promotes the ALARA (as low as  reasonably achievable) concept in guiding the number and nature of radiographic  studies obtained in children [59], and efforts are routinely made to limit the  number of snapshots and the total fluoroscopy time during these tests.&nbsp; Despite concern regarding exposure of the  pelvic organs to ionizing radiation with childhood cystograms, there are presently  no data suggesting deleterious effects on future effect on gonadal function or  an increased risk of pelvic malignancies. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nuclear  cystography reliably detects all grades of vesicoureteral reflux and may be  more sensitive for the detection of intermittent VUR [60].48 At the author&rsquo;s  institution bladder pressures are routinely monitored through a dual lumen  catheter during the filling phase of a nuclear cystogram providing a nuclear  cystometrogram [22]. This technique permits the measurement of the intravesical  pressure at the onset of reflux as well as other changes suggestive of a  non-compliant bladder or bladder dysfunction (Figure 5A,B).</p>
  <p><img src="vur/site img/Fig 5A.jpg" alt="Fig 5A" width="689" height="479"><br>

    Fig 5B<br>
  </p>
  <p>Bladder pressure at the onset of reflux has been  demonstrated as a predictor of spontaneous VUR resolution independent of grade  [21]. In addition to higher bladder pressure, independent predictors of VUR  resolution on nuclear cystometrogram included the onset of reflux occurring at  greater instilled bladder volumes [20].<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catheterization  can be a traumatic experience for a young child. Efforts to decrease the  traumatic nature of the procedure include the use of lubricants containing  local anesthetics, use of child life specialists, and conscious sedation.  Decision-analysis tools [61] and other radiographic modalities such as  ultrasound [62] and magnetic resonance imaging [63] have been employed with  some success in detection of VUR, but their sensitivity lags behind cystograms,  and so the rate of adoption has been low. Typically, cystograms are repeated annually;  however, it has been suggested that in children less likely to resolve VUR, the  interval between cystograms should be lengthened to decrease exposure to  radiation, the number of traumatic studies, and cost [64]. Recent advances in  the ability to predict timing of spontaneous resolution should aid in  determining follow-up time to minimize the number of repeat cystograms  [19,20,65]. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Assessment of Renal Scars</em></strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renal scarring is believed to occur  when infected urine comes in contact with renal parenchyma; it has been  associated with an increased risk of hypertension, proteinuria, and renal  insufficiency [3,66].&nbsp; In a meta-analysis  examining the presence of renal damage in children hospitalized with urinary  tract infection, one study found that approximately 34% of children with  pyelonephritis had VUR, and of those with VUR and pyelonephritis, 72% had an  abnormal DMSA scan [67]. DMSA scintigraphy, in which the radioactive agent  binds to the proximal tubules, has been found to be a more sensitive study than  intravenous pyelogram (IVP) for the detection of reflux nephropathy [68]. The  scan can also detect changes of acute pyelonephritis with greater sensitivity  and specificity than CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound [69] (Figure 6).<br>

Mercaptoacetyltriglycine<strong> (</strong>MAG3) has an improved ability to  detect renal scarring compared to IVP. Renal scans permit determination of  relative renal function and multiple reports demonstrate a high degree of  correlation with respect to relative renal function determined with different  types of renal scans [70]. The DMSA scan is considered by many to be the most  sensitive test for renal scar detection; however, the reported sensitivity rate  of the MAG3 compared to the DMSA varies from 88% to equal to or slightly better  than a DMSA scan [70-72]. Advantages of MAG3 include lower radiation exposure,  cost, and time requirement, as well as visualization of the collecting system  which may improve specificity compared to DMSA in those with significant  dilation of the collecting system [70].</p>
  <p><strong><em>Reflux Nephropathy/Renal Scarring</em></strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least one-third of VUR patients  have renal scars [46,73] and the risk of scarring may be highest with the first  febrile UTI.&nbsp; The presence of scarring  implies regions of renal damage and increases the risk for long-term adverse  sequelae. In newborns with VUR, scars have been detected in association with  high-grade reflux before the occurrence of clinical UTI [74]. These &ldquo;congenital  scars&rdquo; are thought to be regions of focal dysplasia or hypoplasia resulting  from abnormal nephrogenesis as opposed to damaged normal tissue following  pyelonephritis. Since DMSA scans are not routinely performed on neonates, it is  unknown what proportion of renal scars attributed to infectious injury are  actually due to abnormalities of embryogenesis [75]. The ultimate significance  of these regions of dysplasia remains to be determined; however, they are  regions of diminished renal function and can be associated with significant morbidity  and mortality independent of the development of infection-associated renal  scarring [76].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children with renal scars are more  likely to develop additional scars than children without renal scars [77-79].&nbsp; One retrospective study of 120 patients  demonstrated a significantly higher chance of developing a breakthrough urinary  tract infection in those with grades III-V reflux and an abnormality on  baseline DMSA scan (60%) compared to those without an abnormality (6%) [80]. In  one study with a mean follow-up of 12 years after an anti-reflux operation,  children with unilateral renal scars had an 11% chance of developing  hypertension and an 18.5% chance if they had bilateral renal scars [81]. Others  have suggested the incidence of hypertension in children with bilateral renal  scars is about 20% [82]. Children with severe bilateral renal scars are  significantly more likely to develop proteinuria, chronic renal insufficiency  and renal failure than those with unilateral scars or unscarred kidneys [83,84].&nbsp; These data strongly suggest that children  with renal scars are at increased risk for further development of scars and  long-term clinical sequelae.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><em>VUR Grade and Renal Scarring</em></strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children with VUR and UTIs are at an  increased risk for renal scarring compared to children with UTI and no reflux.  In the International Reflux Study, 50% of children with grades III or IV reflux  had scars at study entry [68]. Multiple studies demonstrate a direct  correlation between increased prevalence of renal scarring and higher grades of  reflux [85]. Renal scarring develops less often in non-dilating forms of reflux  [76,77,86]. The chance of developing further renal parenchymal loss has also  been shown to be higher in children with grade III-V reflux than in those with  grade I-II [44,87].<strong> </strong>Renal scars have  also been demonstrated to be a negative predictor of VUR resolution independent  of reflux grade [17].<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The association of renal scars with  higher grades of reflux and risk for subsequent scars as well as decreased  resolution rates lead some to conclude that the standard initial evaluation of  a child with a febrile UTI should begin with a renal scan and not a VCUG (the  &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; approach). Only in those children with an abnormal scan should a  VCUG be obtained.&nbsp; The benefit of such an  approach would be a reduction in the number of children undergoing VCUG and the  identification of reflux in a higher risk group; in theory, patients with  reflux but no structural or functional renal abnormalities might go undiagnosed  with this approach, but the absence of such renal abnormalities suggests that  the reflux is not likely to be clinically significant.&nbsp; The use of an ultrasound instead of a renal  scan has not been accepted because of the decreased sensitivity of the  ultrasound.&nbsp; One study noted that up to  25% of patients with cortical defects on DMSA had a normal ultrasound,  providing further data on the utility of renal scans in the evaluation of  children with febrile UTIs [88].</p>
  <p><strong>OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</strong><br>
    <strong><em>Endoscopic Treatment</em></strong><br>
    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Following FDA approval of the use of  dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA) (Deflux&reg;, Q-Med,  Uppsala, Sweden) for the treatment of primary VUR, parents and physicians began  to view endoscopic treatment as an alternative to starting their child on an  undefined duration of prophylactic antibiotics [89]. In the first 5 years after  its approval, the number of patients undergoing endoscopic antireflux surgery  doubled, with no corresponding change in the number of patients undergoing open  ureteral reimplantation [90].&nbsp; Dx/HA is  the only FDA approved commercially available injectable treatment for reflux in  the United States.&nbsp; It is a synthetic  mixture of dextran microspheres in a hyaluronic acid gel. The dextranomer  particle size is larger than that of polytetrafluoroethylene particles which should  prevent the complication of lymphatic migration previously demonstrated with  polytetrafluoroethylene [91].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the reflux resolution rate  is not as high as that with open ureteral reimplantation, endoscopic correction  of VUR offers a minimally invasive, outpatient procedure with a low risk of  complications. While it is a seemingly simple procedure, several studies have  demonstrated a learning curve with improved results obtained with increasing  experience [92-94]. Other factors associated with successful endoscopic  correction include lower reflux grade, lack of lower urinary tract voiding  dysfunction symptoms, increased volume of Dx/HA injected, visual assessment of  mound configuration following injection, and surgical technique [94-96].<strong></strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the short term, VUR resolution  rates for a single ureter treated with Dx/HA range from 59% to 95% [94]. If  patients undergo a second injection for persistent VUR, the success rate is  improved, but a third injection is rarely curative [89,92,97]. The long-term  durability of successful endoscopic correction of reflux is not well  documented. There is a single long-term study documenting a persistent 95%  efficacy for polytetrafluoroethylene with a mean follow-up of 14 years [98]. Most  studies of Dx/HA only report the results of cystograms at three months or one  year following the procedure.&nbsp; In studies  using bovine-cross-linked collagen, the high failure rate did not occur until  years later, raising concerns regarding the long-term efficacy of Dx/HA [99].  Despite the relatively short-term follow-up, recurrent reflux rates between11%  and 26% between 3 and 12 months following a single Dx/HA acid copolymer  injection have been reported [100,101]. One longer-term study of 49 patients demonstrated  resolution of reflux at both three and 12 months after injection, but 13%  recurred at a mean of three years post-injection [92].&nbsp; It is unclear if reflux recurrence following  initial successful injection of Dx/HA is related to technical (e.g. injection  technique and learning curve), patient (e.g. elimination habits), or Dx/HA  characteristics (e.g. mound migration and shrinkage), or some combination of  these. <br>
The uncertainty over long-term success with  Dx/HA may suggest a need for long-term monitoring of children undergoing this  treatment.&nbsp; Some have suggested that monitoring  should only be considered for those who have recurrent febrile UTIs. Aside from  potential failure, calcification of the implant secondary to a foreign body  reaction has recently been reported as another potential long-term factor [102].&nbsp; Mound calcification is not unique to Dx/HA  and has been described with many endoscopically injected agents [103,104]. However,  calcification can be confused with ureterolithiasis, and providers must  maintain a high level of suspicion for this entity to avoid unnecessary  diagnostic tests and surgical interventions [105].&nbsp; The likelihood of ureteral obstruction  following Dx/HA appears to be about 0.6% [106], and typically requires ureteral  reimplantation with excision of the affected segment.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Ureteral Reimplantation</em></strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surgical treatment of  vesicoureteral reflux has evolved over the last five decades. A lower abdominal  transverse incision is typically used, leaving a small scar in the skin crease  that frequently becomes inconspicuous. Multiple different techniques for  ureteral reimplantation have been performed, with the primary difference being  intravesical surgery, where the bladder is opened and the ureters are dissected  intravesically, versus extravesical reimplantation, where the ureters are  dissected away from the bladder wall without opening the bladder, are left  attached to the bladder mucosa, and reimplanted under flaps of bladder muscle<br> 
(Figure 7).<br>
<img src="vur/site img/Fig 7.jpg" alt="Fig 7" width="819" height="615"><br>
There is no clear  documentation of any of particular technique being superior [10], and selection  of a given technique is typically individualized to the child at the discretion  of the operating physician. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advancements in analgesia, surgical  techniques, and the understanding that children undergoing ureteral  reimplantation for primary VUR rarely need ureteral stents or prolonged bladder  drainage has improved the length of stay and decreased the morbidity of the  procedure [107]. Several series report patients undergoing both intravesical  and extravesical ureteral reimplantation surgery as outpatients [108-110].  Recent studies have documented the use of laparoscopic and robotic  ureteroneocystotomy in attempts to further reduce perioperative morbidity [111].  Results of multiple series document success rates with open ureteral  reimplantation of greater than 95% and close to 100% for lower grades of reflux  [112-114]. The procedures do carry risks of anesthesia and potential  complications including ureteral obstruction, persistent reflux, infection and  bleeding [10]. General tenets of ureteral reimplantation include minimizing  ureteral handling, excision of the intravesical ureteral segment, development  of a tunnel at least five times the diameter of the ureteral lumen, and  creation of a tension-free anastomosis. In large ureters, tailoring through  either excision or plication may be necessary to facilitate achievement of an  adequate intravesical tunnel.&nbsp; </p>
              In patients in whom surgical intervention is considered,  timing of elective surgery remains a matter of debate.&nbsp; Most studies evaluating spontaneous  resolution rates for VUR have followed patients for 5 years.&nbsp; Although this endpoint is presumably based on  the fact that the likelihood of <em>de novo</em> reflux nephropathy declines after age 5 [115], many clinicians and families  infer that children who have failed to resolve their reflux by that time should  undergo corrective surgery.&nbsp; However, in  children without infections, timing of surgery can often be delayed; ureteral  reimplantations in post-pubertal children and adults have been reported, with  modifications in surgical technique owing to the differences in body habitus  between adults and children, but with generally good outcomes &nbsp;[116].&nbsp;
<p><strong>INDIVIDUALIZED MANAGEMENT </strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While VUR itself can be simply  defined, more detailed research confirms that VUR is not a single condition but  rather occurs with wide variations in severity and impact.&nbsp; The answers to many questions regarding  reflux remain unknown; however, it is clear that definitive treatment and even  diagnosis of VUR is of questionable clinical benefit for many patients. Currently,  the decision to perform surgery or to continue or stop antibiotic prophylaxis  is based on physician and parent assessment of risks and benefits as we  currently understand them.&nbsp; Although the  decision to pursue surgery has traditionally been based predominantly on the  grade of reflux, a truly informed decision must consider multiple other  variables, such as patient age, gender, history of UTIs, renal status, and likeliness  and timing of spontaneous resolution.&nbsp; A  patient&rsquo;s social situation and parental preferences, as well as willingness to  comply with either conservative management or postoperative care, must also be taken  into consideration. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple prognostic factors relative  to a child&rsquo;s chance for spontaneous reflux resolution have been defined [16,17,20,21]<em>. </em>One of the predictive factors  independent of VUR grade identified in these studies included the instilled  bladder volume at the onset of reflux.&nbsp;  Reporting the bladder volume at the onset of reflux as additional predictive  information should become standard practice for those performing VCUGs or  nuclear cystograms.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attempting to determine the likelihood  and timing of spontaneous VUR resolution in a particular child while taking  into account multiple prognostic variables such as age, gender, grade of VUR,  bladder volume at onset of reflux, presence of dysfunctional voiding, history  of UTIs, laterality and duplication is extremely complex. To this end, a  user-friendly neural network that incorporates all these predictive factors is  available for use at <a href="http://godot.urol.uic.edu/urocomp/svm_vur.html">http://godot.urol.uic.edu/urocomp/svm_vur.html</a><br>

The use and accuracy of this model was validated on an international  basis in a group of Japanese children [65]. For children who have had a renal  scan, a second computer model was generated incorporating the additional renal  scan data to improve prognostic accuracy and is available at the same website  [20]. <br>

<p><strong>FUTURE DIRECTION</strong> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although  improved accuracy regarding the likelihood and timing of spontaneous VUR  resolution permits better management decisions, additional data is needed.&nbsp; Further studies are needed to define an  individual child&rsquo;s risk of subsequent pyelonephritis, renal damage, and  ultimately clinical sequelae.&nbsp; Prospective  studies such as the RIVUR trial should help define which children benefit from  antibiotic prophylaxis, but retrospective studies assessing long-term outcomes  in adults with a history of VUR should be pursued to better define those at  greatest risk for development of clinical sequelae. Though somewhat limited  relative to prospective studies, well designed retrospective studies may  minimize these limitations and have the advantage of providing needed  information now as opposed to decades from now.</p>
