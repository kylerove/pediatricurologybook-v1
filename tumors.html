  <p>I.&nbsp; Introduction:</p>
  <p>Testis tumors are  rare in children compared with testis tumors occurring post-pubertally or with other  genitourinary tumors in childhood such as Wilms tumor.&nbsp; The incidence of testis tumor in children is  only 1.6 per 1 million person-years.1&nbsp; Until the last decades of the 20th  century, prepubertal testis tumors were treated much the same as their adult  counterparts due to a paucity of information on the behavior of the much rarer  prepubertal tumors.&nbsp; This approach might  make sense if prepubertal tumors represented the tail end of a normally  distributed incidence of tumors with age.&nbsp;  However, there is actually a bimodal age distribution for testis tumors  with a large peak in young adults and a much smaller peak in the first 3 years  of life.2&nbsp; This bimodal age distribution  reflects more fundamental differences between prepubertal and postpubertal  testis tumors.&nbsp; These differences include  the typical tumor histology in each group, the malignant potential of tumors at  different ages, and the molecular biological differences between prepubertal  and postpubertal tumors. </p>
  <p>The most striking  difference between prepubertal and postpubertal tumors is the incidence  distribution of different tumor types.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Testis tumors are generally classified by  the putative cell of origin.&nbsp; Germ cell  tumors include seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and  teratoma.&nbsp; Epidermoid cysts are generally  considered a monodermal form of teratoma.&nbsp;  Stromal tumors include Leydig cell tumor, Sertoli cell tumor and  juvenile granulosa cell tumor.&nbsp;  Gonadoblastomas, which occur almost exclusively in the setting of  disorders of sexual development, contain both germ cell and stromal elements.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;Mixed germ cell tumors which contain 2 or more  histological types are particularly common in adolescents and adults whereas  prepubertal germ cell tumors are virtually always of a single histological  type.&nbsp; Testicular tumors may also be  classified based on their clinical behavior as benign or malignant.&nbsp; Seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma  and yolk sac tumors are malignant.&nbsp;  Teratomas are universally benign in prepubertal patients, but may behave  in a malignant fashion in adolescents and adults.&nbsp; Most stromal tumors are benign, though  occasionally malignant behavior is seen, particularly in older patients.&nbsp; The large majority of testicular tumors in  adolescents and adults are malignant germ cell tumors &ndash; most commonly mixed  germ cell tumors with pure seminomas occurring in older men.&nbsp; In contrast, the most common germ cell tumor  in children is a benign teratoma.&nbsp; The  most common malignant tumor in children is a yolk sac tumor, which is very rare  in its pure form in post-pubertal patients.&nbsp;  Overall, approximately 75% of testis tumors in prepubertal patients are  benign.3</p>
  <p>Molecular biological  and histological studies further support the distinct nature of prepubertal and  postpubertal testis tumors.&nbsp; For example,  chromosome 12 abnormalities are seen in nearly all adult malignant germ cell  tumors, but are not seen in prepubertal yolk sac tumors which display  abnormalities in other chromosomes.4&nbsp;  Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN) which is frequently seen in the  testicles of men with malignant germ cell tumors, does not occur in the setting  of prepubertal yolk sac tumor.5&nbsp;&nbsp;  ITGCN is also generally absent in prepubertal testicles harboring a  teratoma, while 88% of testes removed for adult teratoma contain areas of  ITGCN.6-8<br>
  </p>
  <p>These differences  in histological distribution and clinical behavior have led to a divergence in  the management strategies for prepubertal and postpubertal tumors.&nbsp; In children, a testis-sparing approach is  becoming more common given the high incidence of benign tumors in this  population.&nbsp; When a malignant tumor is  identified, orchiectomy and observation with very selective use of chemotherapy  has become the standard approach; retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND)  and radiation therapy play a very limited role.</p>

  <p>II. Clinical  Presentation/Evaluation<br>
    The majority of testis  tumors present as a palpable testicular mass detected by the patient, a parent,  or by a physician on routine physical examination.&nbsp; Occasionally patients will present with a  hydrocele.&nbsp; Therefore, in a child with a  hydrocele that obscures physical examination of the testis, an ultrasound  should be obtained.&nbsp; Rarely, patients may  present with pain.&nbsp; Once a testis tumor  is suspected, a thorough physical examination is undertaken.&nbsp; In most cases the general examination will be  normal.&nbsp; Signs related to metastatic  disease are uncommon in children as the most common sites &ndash; the retroperitoneum  and lungs &ndash; rarely result in physical findings.&nbsp;  But occasionally signs of androgenization or other physical findings  will be present suggesting a particular tumor type or advanced disease. &nbsp;Imaging of the primary tumor almost always  begins with ultrasonography.&nbsp; Ultrasound  distinguishes testicular from extratesticular masses and the ultrasonographic  appearance of specific testis tumors has been described.9&nbsp; Benign tumors tend to be well-circumscribed  with sharp borders and decreased blood flow on Doppler studies.&nbsp; Epidermoid cysts usually demonstrate  echogenic debris within the well-defined cyst.&nbsp;  Yolk sac tumors tend to be more solid in appearance.&nbsp; However, the ultrasonographic features, while  suggestive, are not diagnostic.&nbsp; When the  clinical findings and ultrasound are suggestive of a benign tumor, no further  evaluation is undertaken.&nbsp; But in cases  where malignancy is suspected a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the  abdomen and pelvis is obtained to identify retroperitoneal involvement.&nbsp; A chest x-ray or chest CT will identify  pulmonary metastases.<br>

  &nbsp; <br>
    Testis tumor  markers are an important tool in the evaluation of testis tumors in children  and adolescents.&nbsp; Both human chorionic  gonadotropin (HCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are important testis tumor serum  markers in adolescents and adults.&nbsp; Since  yolk sac tumors do not elaborate HCG, AFP is the only important tumor marker in  prepubertal patients.&nbsp; AFP is elaborated  by 90% of yolk sac tumors in children.&nbsp;  An important caveat in the use of AFP for these patients is that serum  AFP levels can normally be as high as 50,000 ng/mL in the newborn dropping to  approximately 300 ng/mL by 2 months of age.&nbsp;  AFP levels do not achieve &ldquo;normal&rdquo; values until nearly 1 year of age.10  &nbsp;Therefore, while an elevated AFP in a  child over 1 year old with a testis tumor almost always reflects the presence  of a yolk sac tumor, an &ldquo;elevated&rdquo; level in infants can occur in the setting of  a benign tumor.&nbsp; The post-operative status  of tumor markers is also important.&nbsp;  Tumor marker serum levels should fall at a predictable rate based on the  biological half-life of each marker (approximately 5 days for AFP and 48 hours  for HCG).&nbsp; Failure of the markers to  decline at the expected rate reflects the likely persistence of disease.</p>
  <p>There is no  universally accepted staging system for pediatric testis tumors.&nbsp; Prepubertal patients are generally staged  based on the extent of local disease, the presence or absence of metastatic  disease based on radiographic imaging (CT of the chest and abdomen), and the  persistence or decline of elevated tumor markers post-operatively.&nbsp; In the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group staging  system, patients with locally confined disease, negative radiographic studies,  and the expected decline in tumor markers post-operatively are designated Stage  1.&nbsp; Patients with microscopically  positive margins in the scrotum or spermatic cord and/or with persistently  elevated tumor markers after orchiectomy, are designated stage 2.&nbsp; Patients who underwent transcrotal biopsy  prior to orchiectomy at a separate setting are also considered stage 2.&nbsp; Stage 3 patients are those with  retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy; and those with distant metastases (most  commonly in the lungs) are designated stage 4. Adolescents with germ cell  tumors are generally staged as adults utilizing the TNM system of the American  Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union Against Cancer.11  Because treatment options are more variably applied to post-pubertal tumors,  this staging system is more complex than that employed in children.&nbsp; But it is still based on the issues of local  tumor extent, retroperitoneal lymph node involvement, the presence or absence  of distant metastases, and the post-operative status of tumor markers.</p>
  <p>III.&nbsp; Surgical Management<br>
    While inguinal orchiectomy  with early ligation of the cord has been the historical approach to testicular  tumors, increasing consideration has been given to performing testis-sparing  surgery for benign testicular tumors.12 Tumor excision without  orchiectomy is particularly attractive in prepubertal patients because most  tumors are benign in this population. An elevated AFP level in a child over 1  year of age virtually always reflects the presence of a yolk sac tumor and  precludes a testis-sparing approach. However, in all infants, and in older  children with a normal AFP, the likelihood of a benign tumor is considerable.  This is also true in boys presenting with androgenization. &nbsp;In adolescents, as in adults, a testis-sparing  approach must be used very judiciously since most post-pubertal tumors are  malignant.&nbsp; However, in adolescents with  normal tumor markers and an ultrasound appearance highly suggestive of a benign  lesion, such as an epidermoid cyst, testis-sparing may be considered.</p>
  <p>For a testis-sparing  approach, the testis is delivered into the inguinal incision (the cord having  been occluded with a non-crushing clamp or vessel loop), the field is draped  off with towels and the tunica vaginalis is opened (see Figure). The tumor is  excised or enucleated and sent for frozen section.&nbsp; If a benign histology is confirmed, then the  testicular defect is closed with absorbable suture and the testis is returned  to the scrotum. If a malignancy is detected, or the frozen section is nondiagnostic,  then an orchiectomy is performed.&nbsp;  Reports from small series suggest that this approach is safe and is  effective in preserving testicular tissue.9,13&nbsp; Valla et al reported on 83 benign lesions 2/3  of which were managed with tumor enucleation.9&nbsp; With an average follow-up of 4.8 years, they  saw no cases of testicular atrophy or tumor recurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lesions successfully treated with tumor  enucleation included teratomas, epidermoid cysts, Sertoli cell tumors, and  Leydig cell tumors.&nbsp; Even when the testis  appears completely replaced by tumor on ultrasound, enucleation may leave  significant normal testicular tissue that was merely compressed by the benign  lesion.14 </p>
  <p>IV.&nbsp; Adjuvant therapy<br>
Following excision of the  primary tumor, universally benign tumors require no further evaluation or  treatment.&nbsp; Treatment options for  potentially malignant tumors include surveillance, chemotherapy,  retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), and radiation therapy.&nbsp; Virtually all germ cell tumors are sensitive  to platinum-based multiagent chemotherapy which plays a major role in their  management.&nbsp; RPLND plays an important  staging and therapeutic role for mixed germ cell tumors in adolescents, but is  rarely employed in cases of prepubertal yolk sac tumor.&nbsp; Radiation therapy is primarily used in  treating seminoma &ndash; a very rare tumor in the pediatric population.&nbsp; The specific adjuvant therapy for a given  patient is dependent on tumor histology and stage.</p>
  <p><em>Yolk sac tumor</em><br>
    Pure yolk sac tumors occur  almost exclusively in infants and very young children.&nbsp; Nearly all are managed with surveillance or  platinum-based chemotherapy.&nbsp; RPLND,  which plays a central role in the staging and therapy of adults with mixed germ  cell tumors, is rarely employed in children.&nbsp;  This is in part because prepubertal patients are less likely than adults  to have metastases limited to the retroperitoneum.15&nbsp; Furthermore 80% of prepubertal patients have  clinical stage 1 disease and fewer than 20% will recur with no therapy beyond  orchiectomy.16-21&nbsp; Finally,  the morbidity of RPLND is likely to be greater in children than in adolescents  and adults; the feasibility of a nerve-sparing approach to RPLND in children is  undefined.&nbsp;&nbsp; In children, retroperitoneal  surgery is reserved for biopsy of radiographically equivocal nodes or for  resection of a persistent retroperitoneal mass following chemotherapy.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
  <p>Perhaps the greatest advance  in the management of testicular cancer was the introduction of platinum-based  chemotherapy.&nbsp; Survival for both  prepubertal and adult tumors has increased dramatically since its introduction.&nbsp; Indeed, multiagent chemotherapy has become  the standard therapy for virtually all metastatic prepubertal testicular  malignancies.&nbsp; The  specific management for patients with yolk sac tumor has been defined by  several multicenter clinical trials.16-21&nbsp; The results of 4 major studies are summarized  in the Table.&nbsp; In all of these studies  stage 1 tumors were managed with orchiectomy followed by surveillance.&nbsp; Surveillance includes frequent physical examinations,  radiographic evaluation of the chest and retroperitoneum, and serum tumor  marker measurement.&nbsp; Patients who  developed metastatic disease were treated with 2-4 courses of multiagent  platinum-based chemotherapy.&nbsp; Patients  who presented with locally advanced disease, metastases, or persistently  elevated serum tumor markers were similarly treated with multiagent platinum-based  chemotherapy.&nbsp; The survival for all  patients with this approach was nearly 100%.</p>
  <p><em>Teratoma</em><br>
While metastatic  disease occurs in up to 60% of adults with teratoma, these tumors are  universally benign in pre-pubertal patients.22-24 &nbsp;&nbsp;Adolescents  with teratoma should undergo orchiectomy and a metastatic evaluation followed  by surveillance for stage 1 disease.&nbsp; Because  of its benign nature, prepubertal teratoma can be managed with testis-sparing  surgery.&nbsp; The vast majority of  prepubertal teratomas are &ldquo;mature&rdquo; teratomas, and for these tumors, no  oncological evaluation or follow-up is necessary.&nbsp; Immature teratomas are characterized by the  presence of embryonal or incompletely differentiated tissue components, most  commonly primitive neuroectodermal structures.4&nbsp;&nbsp; There is some uncertainty regarding  the behavior of immature teratomas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pediatric immature teratomas (regardless of site) generally behave in a  benign fashion if completely resected, though there has been at least one case  report of metastatic disease&nbsp; resulting  from an immature testicular teratoma in a child.25-27&nbsp; Somatic malignancies may also arise in  immature teratomas leading to metastatic spread.&nbsp; This is exceedingly rare in children.&nbsp; Furthermore, if foci of yolk sac tumor are  found in an immature teratoma, then it should be treated as a yolk sac  tumor.&nbsp;&nbsp; While immature teratomas of the  testis can be managed with complete tumor resection alone, consideration should  be given to some clinical and radiographic follow-up in these patients.</p>
  <p>Epidermoid cysts  probably represent a monodermal variant of teratoma.&nbsp; Epidermoid cysts are composed entirely of  keratin-producing squamous epithelium and are universally benign in children  and adults.&nbsp; They can often be suspected  by their typical appearance on ultrasound of a cyst filled with echogenic  layered debris (corresponding to the desquamated keratin) giving an  &ldquo;onion-skin&rdquo; appearance28.&nbsp; They  may be treated by tumor enucleation with no oncological evaluation or  follow-up.9 <br>

  <p>Mixed germ cell  tumors (MGCT) are vanishingly rare in pre-pubertal patients, but account for a  significant proportion of testis tumors in adolescents.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is little data regarding  the behavior of mixed germ cell tumors in adolescents and until further studies  of adolescents with MGCT are undertaken, it seems reasonable to manage them as  adults with observation, RPLND, and/or chemotherapy depending on the specific  histology and stage of the disease.&nbsp; Patients  with stage 1 MGCT may be managed with surveillance.&nbsp; The recurrence rate on surveillance is 25-30%11.&nbsp; Recurrence may be prevented with a modified  nerve-sparing RPLND or 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, but this  &ldquo;over-treats&rdquo; the 70-75% of patients who do not have occult metastatic  disease.&nbsp; On the other hand, when  recurrence occurs on surveillance, more intense therapy is required and so  patients may prefer an RPLND or short course of chemotherapy up front.&nbsp; Generally this dilemma is resolved by  stratifying patients based on the local stage and histology of the primary  tumor.&nbsp; Patients with low risk disease  are usually followed with frequent chest x-rays, tumor marker measurements and  abdominal CT scans.&nbsp; Nearly all  recurrences occur within 2 years of orchiectomy and are treated with  chemotherapy.&nbsp; Patients at higher risk  for recurrence (such as those with vascular invasion, largely embryonal cell  histology, or those who are poorly compliant with therapy) generally undergo a  modified nerve-sparing RPLND.&nbsp; If  microscopically positive nodes are found at the time of RPLND patients may  elect a brief course of chemotherapy, although many with microscopic disease  will be cured by the RPLND alone.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Patients with  radiographic evidence of metastatic disease at presentation or persistently  elevated tumor markers following orchiectomy are treated with 3-4 cycles of  chemotherapy (such as bleomycin, etoposide and cis-platinum).&nbsp; The relapse rate following primary  chemotherapy for metastatic disease is approximately 15%, though it may be as  high as 30% for poor-risk patients.11&nbsp; RPLND may be considered for patients with  very limited retroperitoneal lymph node disease at presentation and  normalization of tumor markers after orchiectomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Some patients with  MGCT treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease will have a residual  retroperitoneal mass following therapy.&nbsp;  If tumor markers have normalized, these residual masses should generally  be resected.&nbsp; 40-50% of residual masses  will contain only necrotic tissue and fibrosis, but 10-20% will have persistent  malignancy and 40-45% will contain mature teratoma.11</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Stromal tumors </em><br>
    Stromal tumors of  the testis are rare in children and adolescents.&nbsp; Leydig cell tumors and juvenile granulosa  cell tumors are universally benign in children.1,29-32&nbsp; Leydig cell tumors usually present between 5  and 10 years of age with precocious puberty.&nbsp;  They may be treated with orchiectomy or tumor enucleation.30,33&nbsp; Contralateral tumors may occur, though they are  rare in children.&nbsp; Adrenal rests along  the spermatic cord and in the testicular hilum may hypertrophy in patients with  precocious puberty due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) mimicking a  Leydig cell tumor.&nbsp; In patients with CAH  the nodules are often multifocal and bilateral.34-36&nbsp; The diagnosis of CAH can generally be made by  demonstrating an elevated serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level.&nbsp; The nodules will usually resolve or significantly  reduce in size with steroid replacement therapy for the CAH.&nbsp; If this occurs, the patient may be followed  with serial examinations.37&nbsp;  Large nodules that fail to regress may be safely enucleated.37-38&nbsp; Juvenile granulosa cell tumors occur almost  exclusively in the first year of life, most in the first 6 months.&nbsp; They bear a light microscopic appearance  similar to ovarian juvenile granulosa cell tumors.&nbsp; Chromosomal mosaicism, structural  abnormalities of the Y chromosome, and ambiguous genitalia are common in boys  with juvenile granulosa cell tumor.39-40&nbsp; Although these children should undergo a  chromosomal analysis, the tumor itself&nbsp;  may be treated by orchiectomy or tumor enucleation with no metastatic  evaluation or adjuvant therapy.31-32</p>
  <p>While approximately  10% of adult Sertoli cell tumors are malignant, malignancy is very rare in  children.29,41&nbsp; While all  reported cases of Sertoli cell tumors in children under 5 years of age have  been benign, there have been a few cases of malignant Sertoli cell tumors in  older children.39,42&nbsp; Tumor  excision is usually adequate treatment for infants, but a metastatic evaluation  should be considered if worrisome gross or histological findings are present  such as large tumor size, areas of necrosis, vascular invasion, cellular  atypia, or increased mitotic activity.&nbsp;  Older children with Sertoli cell tumors should undergo a full metastatic  evaluation.</p>
  <p>Large-cell  calcifying Sertoli cell tumors are clinically and histologically distinct  tumors which occur predominantly in children and adolescents.1,43&nbsp; These tumors are composed of large cells with  abundant cytoplasm and varying degrees of calcification.&nbsp; Approximately 1/3 of patients have an  associated genetic syndrome and/or endocrine abnormality, the most common being  Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and Carney&rsquo;s syndrome.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is  an autosomal dominant disorder consisting of mucocutaneous pigmentation and  hamartomatous intestinal polyposis.&nbsp;  Features of Carney syndrome include myxomas of the skin, soft tissue,  and heart; myxoid lesions of the breast; lentigines of the face and lips;  cutaneous blue nevi; Cushing syndrome; pituitary adenoma; and schwannoma.&nbsp; Patients and first-degree relatives of  patients with large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor should be screened for  these potentially serious syndromes.&nbsp; Whereas  these tumors are occasionally malignant in adults, they have been universally  benign in patients under 25 years of age.&nbsp;  Orchiectomy is sufficient treatment in children, but approximately &frac14; of  patients will have bilateral and/or multifocal disease.&nbsp; A testis-sparing approach has been described  for this rare tumor.44</p>
  <p>Rarely a  prepubertal patient may have a mixed or poorly differentiated stromal  tumor.&nbsp; Most of these behave in a benign  fashion, but concern for malignancy is appropriate when a large number of  mitotic figures are present, the tumor is poorly differentiated, or when local  invasion is seen.29&nbsp; Because  orchiectomy cures most of these patients, RPLND and adjuvant therapy are  probably not indicated in the absence of evidence of metastatic disease.&nbsp; However, given the uncertainty regarding  these tumors, postoperative evaluation and follow-up for the development of  metastatic disease seems prudent.</p>
  <p><em>Testicular cyst</em><br>
Simple testicular cysts may be observed  or, if they are growing, excised.&nbsp; Cystic  dysplasia of the rete testis is a benign tumor found primarily in children.45&nbsp; Ultrasound typically reveals multiple small  cysts arising from the testicular hilum, sometimes compressing the normal  testicular parenchyma.&nbsp; These tumors are universally benign and may  be managed by observation, tumor excision, or orchiectomy if extensive.&nbsp; Associated genitourinary anomalies,  particularly renal agenesis, are common.&nbsp;  Therefore, patients with cystic dysplasia of the rete testis should  undergo upper tract imaging.</p>
  <p>V.&nbsp; Risk factors for testicular tumors</p>
  <p>While most  testicular tumors occur sporadically, some occur in the setting of a  predisposing history.&nbsp; The most studied  association is with undescended testicle (UDT). &nbsp;The risk of testicular cancer in men with a  history of UDT has historically been estimated at 10-40 fold greater than the  general population.&nbsp; More recent studies  have found the risk of testicular cancer in a man with a history of UDT to be  closer to 5-fold that of the general population.&nbsp; This translates into a life-time risk for  these men of 1-2%.&nbsp; Whether early  orchidopexy can ameliorate that risk is unclear, though a recent study suggests  that it may.46&nbsp; The increased  risk of germ cell tumors is reflected in the finding of carcinoma in situ (CIS)  in 2-4% of men with a history of cryptorchidism.47&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Testicular  microlithiasis (TM) has been identified as a possible risk factor for the  development of testicular cancer.&nbsp; TM  refers to the presence of microcalcifications, usually diffuse, within the  parenchyma of the testis on ultrasound.&nbsp;  The association with testicular malignancies was suggested by the  finding that approximately 25% of adult testes harboring cancer are found to  have TM.&nbsp; But the causal relationship  behind this finding is unclear.&nbsp; TM is  found incidentally in approximately 2% of boys and men undergoing ultrasound  either for testicular symptoms or as part of a screening study of asymptomatic  males.48-51 &nbsp;&nbsp;Six small series  with a total of 152 men (including 2 prospective studies) looked at the  development of testicular cancer in testicles initially identified with TM .52-57&nbsp; Three patients (1.8%) in these studies  developed testicular cancer with a median follow-up of 41 months.&nbsp; None of the 81 patients in the 2 prospective  studies developed tumors.&nbsp; There is still  insufficient data to quantify the risk, if any, of testicular cancer in boys or  men incidentally found to have TM.&nbsp;  Studies suggest that TM may be most significant when it occurs in conjunction  with other risk factors for testicular cancer, such as men with infertility or  a history of contralateral testicular cancer.58-59&nbsp; </p>
  <p>While rare,  certain disorders of sexual development (DSD) harbor a very significant risk  for the development of gonadal tumors.&nbsp; Some  disorders, such as complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, have an increased  risk comparable to that of other patients with testicular maldescent.&nbsp; But unique to patients with DSD are the risks  of tumor formation in dysgenetic or streak gonads.&nbsp; This risk seems to exist almost exclusively  in patients with Y chromatin.60&nbsp;  For example, patients with Turner syndrome and any portion of a Y  chromosome in their karyotype have an approximately 12% risk of tumor  development; while patients with traditional Turner syndrome and a 45 XO  karyotype are at no significant risk for gonadal tumors. &nbsp;Similarly the gonads of patients with pure  gonadal dysgenesis and Y chromatin as well as the &ldquo;streak&rdquo; gonad of patients  with mixed gonadal dysgenesis are at a 15-30% risk for tumor development.</p>
  <p>The tumors arising  in the setting of gonadal dysgenesis are usually gonadoblastomas.&nbsp; While gonadoblastomas are benign, they are  prone to the development of malignant degeneration and overt malignant behavior  is seen in 10% of cases.61&nbsp;  While most cases of malignancy occur after puberty, there have been  cases reported in children as well.&nbsp;  Prophylactic removal of dysgenetic gonads should be undertaken early in  life in patients with at-risk karyotypes.60&nbsp; Gonadectomy is sufficient treatment for  gonadoblastoma.&nbsp; If malignant  degeneration has occurred, then further therapy may be warranted.&nbsp; When malignancies occur, dysgerminoma (aka  seminoma when it occurs in a testis) is the most common histological type.&nbsp; These tumors are very radiosensitive and the  outlook for these patients is generally favorable.</p>
  <p>VI.&nbsp; Paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma</p>
  <p>Paratesticular  rhabdomyosarcomas usually present with an enlarging painless scrotal mass.&nbsp; By the time of presentation distinction from  a primary testis tumor is usually not possible on physical exam, though the  extratesticular nature of the tumor is usually apparent on ultrasound.&nbsp; The initial management for paratesticular  rhabdomyosarcomas is an inguinal excision of the tumor and testis.&nbsp; Trans-scrotal biopsies of solid scrotal  masses should be avoided due to the risk of seeding of the incision if the mass  is indeed a rhabdomyosarcoma.&nbsp; The excision  should be performed just as for a testicular malignancy.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The metastatic  evaluation for paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma includes a CT of the chest,  abdomen, and pelvis.&nbsp; A majority of  patients will have clinical stage 1 disease.&nbsp;  The most common sites of metastases are the retroperitoneum and  lungs.&nbsp; Patients with retroperitoneal  metastases undergo a modified unilateral nerve-sparing RPLND.&nbsp; All patients receive chemotherapy and those  with positive retroperitoneal nodes receive radiation therapy as well.&nbsp; The role of staging RPLND in patients with  clinical stage 1 disease is based on experience in the Intergroup  Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies (IRS).62&nbsp; IRS-III  (from 1984-1991) required a staging unilateral RPLND for all clinical stage 1  patients.&nbsp; In IRS-IV (from 1991-1997)  patients with a negative CT scan did not undergo staging RPLND (and did not  receive radiation to the retroperitoneum).&nbsp;  This approach resulted in a worrisome decrease in the percentage of  patients diagnosed with metastatic disease in IRS-IV, particularly among  adolescents.&nbsp; Furthermore, adolescents  with clinical stage 1 disease in IRS-IV had a 3-year event-free survival (EFS) of  only 68% compared to a 100% survival for patients with recognized lymph node  involvement (who received radiation and more intense chemotherapy)&nbsp; &ndash; presumably due to under-staging and  under-treatment of those stage 1 patients with occult retroperitoneal disease.&nbsp; Such discrepancies were not seen in the  prepubertal patients.&nbsp; Based on these  data, patients over 10 years of age with or without radiographic evidence of  retroperitoneal disease should undergo a staging RPLND and receive radiation in  addition to chemotherapy if the lymph nodes are positive.&nbsp; Younger children with a normal abdominal CT  may be treated with chemotherapy alone without a staging RPLND.&nbsp; Overall survival rates for patients with paratesticular  rhabdomyosarcoma approach 90%.62<strong></strong><br>
