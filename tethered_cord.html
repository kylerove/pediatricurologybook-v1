  <p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
  <p>Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) is a  condition that is characterized by a constellation of neurologic, urologic, and  orthopedic findings, which occur as the result of inappropriate tissue adherence  of the spinal cord to surrounding tissues from congenital or acquired causes.&nbsp; In a normal individual, as the spine flexes  or extends, the spinal cord freely moves within the spinal column.&nbsp; If the spinal cord is attached to the column,  then as the spine flexes or extends, the cord is placed on tension, which  results in an abnormal stretching of the spinal cord resulting in a progressive  symptom complex.<br>
    This  phenomenon was first described nearly a century ago by Fuchs in 1910 to explain  the pathophysiology of urinary incontinence upon flexion in a group of patients  with myelomeningocele (Fuchs 1910).&nbsp; In  1953, Dr. George Garceau described a series of patients with progressive  spastic paralysis, with each of the patients found to have a thickened filum  terminale leading to the characterization of &ldquo;cord traction symptoms&rdquo; (Garceau  1953).&nbsp; The first use of the term  tethered cord syndrome was from Hoffman et al in 1976, when he used this term  to describe a series of 31 patients with elongated cords whose neurologic  symptoms improved following the sectioning of the thick filum terminale  (Hoffman 1976).The incidence of this disorder is approximately 0.05 to 0.25 per  1000 births (Solmaz 2011).&nbsp; Any condition  that fixes the spinal cord can cause TCS, however, it is most commonly the  result of spinal dysraphism and most recognizable when the conus medullaris  ends below the mid-body spinal level of L2.&nbsp;  The term TCS encompasses the various progressive symptoms that occur as  a result of spinal cord tension.</p>
  <p>EMBRYOLOGY:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is imperative to have a basic  understanding of spinal cord development and embryology to understand the  congenital causes and symptoms produced from tethered cord syndrome.&nbsp; The human nervous system derives from a  specialized portion of ectoderm in the developing fetus known as the neural  plate.&nbsp; The process of spinal cord  development is first initiated by primary neurulation, which occurs between day  18 and 28 of development.&nbsp; During primary  neurulation, the neural plate begins to involute, leading to a neural groove  with accompanying lateral folds.&nbsp; As  these folds are created, they begin to fuse over the midline of the dorsal  groove.&nbsp; Closure of the neural tube  begins cephalad, at the area that corresponds to the future cervical spinal  cord and continues in the caudal direction (Nolte 2002).&nbsp; As the neural tube closes, the proximal and  distal neuropore remain patent with closure occurring on day 25 for the rostral  end and day 27 for the caudal end. <br>
    The sacral spinal cord develops  as a result of a process known as secondary neurulation during gestational days  28-41, in which undifferentiated cells from the primitive streak, distal to the  neural tube begin to form a caudal cell mass.&nbsp;  The caudal cell mass forms vacuoles, which fuse to form the distal  neural tube.&nbsp; This serves as the basis  for the formation of the conus medullaris, cauda equina, and filum  terminale.&nbsp; As the end of secondary  neurulation occurs, the ventricularis terminalis, a cystic structure at the  caudal portion of the neural tube, develops and marks the site of the future  conus medullaris (Lew 2007).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ventricularis terminalis is  initially at the coccygeal level, however as the gestational period of growth  continues, the caudal spinal cord undergoes a process known as retrogressive  differentiation, resulting in the formation of the filum terminale, cauda  equina, and the ascent of the conus medullaris into the vertebral column (Lew  2007).&nbsp; The portion of neural tube that  is distal to the ventricularis terminalis forms the fibrous portion of the  filum which attaches to the sacrococcygeal region of the vertebrae, and as the  column outgrows the cord, this fibrous band elongates (Barson 1970).&nbsp; The most rapid ascent of the conus medullaris  occurs during weeks 11-17 and the conus medullaris reaches the adult level of  the L1/L2 intervertebral disc space at 2-3 months post-term (Barson 1970).</p>

</script>         <p>An  understanding of neural tube development is the key in understanding,  diagnosing, and treating tethered cord syndrome.&nbsp; The normal cord ends above the mid-body level  of L2 with certain variability in the population.&nbsp; Patients more than 3 months of age and  definitely more than 6 months of age, with a conus found below the mid-body of  L2 should be evaluated for tethered cord syndrome </p>

              <p align="center">Figure 1:&nbsp; Depiction of the conus medullaris tethered  below the mid body of L2 from a lipoma (image on the right; normal spine and  cord in image on the left)</p>
              <p>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basis for the constellation of  symptoms observed with tethered cord syndrome is due to the attachment of the  cord to surrounding tissue leading to tension and stretch on the cord as the  individual flexes or extends.&nbsp; The  symptoms that result from this stretch can be explained by what occurs at the  biochemical level.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early studies by Yamada et al used  reflective spectrophotometry to observe alterations in the metabolic activity  of mitochondria in a series of 7 pediatric patients with TCS prior to surgical  release of the tethered cord (Yamada 1981).&nbsp;  They observed the reduction of cytochrome aa3 in tethered  cord subjects, which resulted in dysfunction of the terminal mitochondrial  oxidase of the electron transport chain, resulting in a deficiency of adenosine  triphosphate (ATP) production and subsequent neuronal cell death (Yamada  1981).&nbsp; The reduction of cytochrome aa3  was intensified with increasing cord tension (Yamada 1981).&nbsp; Further work was performed by Schneider et al  who evaluated microcirculation of the distal spinal cord using laser Doppler  flowmetry (LDF) in 10 children with TCS.&nbsp;  They found that following surgical cord release, there was a significant  improvement in the amount of spinal cord blood flow to the distal cord  (Schneider 1993).&nbsp; This data supports the  theory that the tension placed on the spinal cord in individuals with TCS  results in a state of hypoxia leading to metabolic derangement resulting in  neurologic signal dysfunction.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clinical symptoms observed in  individuals with TCS indicate that the lesions are located in the lumbosacral  cord (Yamada 2004).&nbsp; It has been shown  through cord traction analysis that the area of the spinal cord most vulnerable  to elongation is the conus medullaris and that no elongation occurs superior to  the most inferior pair of dentate ligaments, which act as a buffer for spinal  cord stretch (Tani 1987, Yamada 2004, Lew 2007, Sarwar 1983).</p>
  <p>CAUSES:</p>
  <p>Tethered cord syndrome can be  caused by any disease state that results in spinal cord immobilization.&nbsp; Etiologies range from congenital diseases to  acquired conditions; congenital causes are the most commonly encountered and  frequently present in an occult fashion.&nbsp;  It continues to be of utmost importance for each clinician to perform a  thorough physical exam for each patient to determine if signs of spinal  dysraphism exist.<br>
    Spinal dysraphisms are the most  commonly encountered congenital causes of TCS and can exist as open or closed  forms.&nbsp; Open spinal dysraphisms are  caused by failure of neurulation and closure of the posterior tissue layers  overlying the cord (Lew 2007).&nbsp; The dura  and posterior vertebral arch fail to fuse, which result in the failure of fat  and skin to form in the midline (Lew 2007).&nbsp;  This results in expulsion of neurologic contents that range from spinal  cord to cerebrospinal fluid depending on the timing of failure during  development.&nbsp; Spinal meningocele occur  when there is a late defect in cord development.&nbsp; In this condition, the vertebral bodies  develop, however there is an open defect of the dura mater and overlying tissue  from which the cerebrospinal fluid and arachnoid membranes herniate (Lew  2007).&nbsp; Myelomeningocele is the result of  failure of neuropore fusion leading to the herniation of the meninges and  spinal cord outside the spinal canal.&nbsp; In  this setting, the spinal cord is observed at the skin surface without dermal or  meningeal coverings.<br>
    Closed spinal dysraphisms are  characterized by neural arch defects that are covered with intact skin;  thickened filum terminale is included in this category, which was the first  condition associated with tethered cord syndrome as described by Garceau in  1953.&nbsp; The filum tissue has a diameter of  approximately 0.5 mm, but as it is infiltrated by fatty or fibrous tissue, the  diameter of the filum terminale can exceed 2.0 mm leading to tethered cord  syndrome (Bao 2007).&nbsp; A dermal sinus  tract is another occult condition associated with tethered cord syndrome.&nbsp; It is caused by the incomplete dysjunction of  the cutaneous ectoderm and neural ectoderm during the 4th week of  fetal development (Venkataramana 2011). It results in an epithelial-lined tract  that extends from the skin to the dura mater and can attach to the filum of the  spinal cord (Venkataramana 2011).&nbsp;  Lipoma, lipomeningocele and lipomyelomeningocele are all conditions  which may result in tethered cord syndrome (Blount 2001).&nbsp; Although their name implies a lesion of  adipocytes, histologic analysis has shown that these lesions often contain more  than one cell line such as fibrous, muscular, or neural tissue (Blount 2001,  Lellouch-Tubiana 1999, Muraszko 2000).&nbsp;  This pluripotent tissue extends from the subcutaneous fat through the  lumbosacral fascia to involve the spinal cord resulting in immobilization of  the conus medullaris (Lew 2007). <br>
    In addition to congenital causes  of tethered cord syndrome, there are also acquired causes.&nbsp; Re-tethering of the cord can occur following  surgery to the lower cord for tethered cord release.&nbsp; The cause of this is often attributed to the  development of scar tissue at the surgical site, which acts as an anchor to the  spinal cord.&nbsp; There have been reports of  foreign body reaction as the cause of re-tethering, which occurred from  material used during surgery such as suture and dural graft material  (Martinez-Lage 2010).&nbsp; In addition to the  development of tethered cord syndrome following tethered cord release, it may  also develop following myelomeningocele repair and, in fact, does in 10-30% of  children (Mehta 2010, Balasubramaniam 1990, Shurtleff 1997).&nbsp; Secondary tethered cord syndrome appears to  have two peaks of incidence. One study found a mean age for the development of  secondary TCS was 7.8 years.&nbsp; In the same  series of 202 patients followed after a myelomeningocele repair, 22 required  TCS detethering at a mean age of 7.5 years. (Talamonti 2007). Another study  found that secondary tethered cord syndrome occurs a mean of 8 years and 10  months after primary closure in a series of 8 patients. The mean age at  operation for secondary tethered cord syndrome was roughly 5 years if the  primary cause was lipomeningocele and 11 years 1 month if due to meningomyelocele  (Ohe 2000). While the mean age of development of TCS is during childhood, the  fact that adults also require detethering suggests a bimodal distribution  (Talamonti 2007).<br>
    Other non-congenital causes of  TCS include infections such as arachnoiditis that result in scar tissue which  in turn tethers the spinal cord to the spine.&nbsp;  Spinal cord injuries secondary to trauma can also cause tethered cord  syndrome (Ragnarsson 1986, Henry 1997, Falci 1999).<br>
    Occult tethered cord (OTC) is a  controversial topic which requires brief mention. First described by Khoury et  al in 1990, children were noted to have the symptoms of tethered cord syndrome,  primarily in the form of refractory urinary incontinence (Steinbok 2007);  however, the conus was in the normal location consistent with spina bifida  occulta. Diagnosis was thus based solely on symptoms as imaging reveals a  normal lying conus.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>DIAGNOSIS:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clinical manifestations of  tethered cord syndrome are broad and are often classified based on age.&nbsp; Symptoms often incorporate many body systems  including urologic, neurologic, musculoskeletal and cutaneous.&nbsp; The physical exam plays a large role in the  evaluation of children with possible tethered cord syndrome.&nbsp; Special attention should be paid to the  dorsal spine and lower extremities to evaluate for the common cutaneous and  orthopedic abnormalities. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Routine use of fetal sonography, and  more recently fetal MRI, where indicated, make it possible to detect a spinal  cord abnormality prenatally. &nbsp;The fetal  spinal cord can be easily visualized by sonography and the conus medullaris can  be identified (Sohaey 2009). &nbsp;Sohaey et  al have described the use of fetal sonography and fetal MRI to characterize  both open and closed neural tube defects.&nbsp;  Prenatal diagnosis of spinal dysraphism is important for appropriate  planning and referral but now also offers the possibility of prenatal  intervention. &nbsp;Adzick et al demonstrated  that prenatal versus postnatal myelomeningocele repair decreased the risk of  death and need for shunting at 1 year (2011). Secondary outcomes, including  hindbrain herniation at 12 months and motor skills and ambulation at 30 months,  also improved (Adzick 2011).&nbsp; The long  term effects of fetal myelomeningocele repair have been studied by Clayton et  al. They noted on review of 28 children who underwent fetal myelomeningocele  closure versus age and sex matched controls of those who underwent the standard  postnatal repair, that there were no significant differences in urologic and  bowel outcomes, specifically bladder and bowel management, urinary tract  surgery, bowel surgery, or urodynamics (2011).&nbsp;  Based on these findings, it is therefore critical to follow the bladder and  bowel function of myelomeningocele patients regardless of prenatal or postnatal  surgery (Clayton 2011).<br>
    In the infant and neonate, the  cutaneous manifestations may be the only indicator of tethered cord syndrome  (Lew 2007, Hertzler 2010).&nbsp; Cutaneous  stigmata are present in 46-70% of children with tethered cord syndrome (Bui  2007, Warder 1994).&nbsp; Signs of dysfunction  may include hypertrichosis, lipomas, hemangiomas, nevi and dermal sinuses (Lew  2007, Hertzler 2010, Bui 2007).&nbsp; At this  age, orthopedic abnormalities such as leg-length discrepancy, scoliosis, foot  asymmetry, foot deformity such as pes cavus and claw toes may begin to be noticeable  (Bui 2007).&nbsp; Orthopedic deformities are  noted in more than 90% of patients with TCS (Bui 2007, Warder 1994, Warder  2001).&nbsp; <br>
    In the neonatal and infant years,  urological abnormalities may not be readily apparent (Bui 2007) in the absence  of cutaneous manifestations or orthopedic deformities. In this age group, indirect  signs of neurogenic bladder such as urinary tract infections may prompt  evaluation. Urodynamics may detect subtle neurogenic bladder dysfunction at  this age when there is clinical suspicion of TCS (Bui 2007). Similarly,  neurogenic bowel dysfunction may only be indicated by constipation at this age.  Again, in the face of obvious spinal cord abnormality, the management algorithm  is very clear. However, where subtle abnormalities in bladder or bowel function  are detected, the physician should have a low threshold to initiate the  appropriate testing to assess for underlying neurologic disease.<br>
    As the child begins to grow and  then starts walking, motor and sensory sequelae may become the primary  symptoms.&nbsp; Neurologic symptoms exist in  up to 64% of children with TCS (Bui 2007, Warder 1994).&nbsp; Motor symptoms are the most common followed  by bowel and bladder dysfunction, pain, and finally, sensory complaints (Warder  2001).&nbsp; Motor dysfunction is characterized  by asymmetrical weakness and gait difficulty or delayed ambulation (Bui  2007).&nbsp; Pain is often non-dermatomal and  is localized to the lower back, perineum, and/or legs (Lew 2007).&nbsp; Sensory deficits are commonly localized to  the feet and perineum and involve multiple myotomes (Bui 2007).&nbsp; <br>
    Once the child is of toilet-training  age, the urologic dysfunction associated with TCS may become more apparent as  the child can help describe symptoms.&nbsp; A  thorough history and physical exam should be performed with careful attention  to histories that describe the loss of previous milestones in continence  (Agarwalla 2007) or new onset problems with bladder or bowel function.&nbsp; Urologic abnormalities are present in  approximately 18% of TCS children (Bui 2007).&nbsp;  Neurogenic bladder is a hallmark abnormality of TCS with symptoms of  incontinence, urgency, increased/abnormal frequency and recurrent urinary tract  infections (Bui 2007, Palmer 1998).&nbsp;  Neurogenic bladder can result in a thickened and trabeculated appearance  to the bladder wall, specifically the detrusor muscle, which can be detected on  bladder ultrasound (Figures 2, 3). </p>

  <p align="left">Figure 3: Transverse  (left) and sagittal (right) ultrasound images of the bladder revealing  trabeculations (arrows)</p>
  <p>If not adequately managed, this  can ultimately result in fibrosis and loss of bladder compliance, which can  lead to high bladder pressures. In the worst cases, these high pressures can be  transmitted to the kidneys, result in vesicoureteral reflux, nephropathy, and  renal failure requiring renal transplant (Figure 4).</p>

  <p align="center">Figure 4:&nbsp; Comparison of normal kidneys (left) with  kidneys affected by high intravesical bladder pressures (right) with noted  hydronephrosis with dilated ureters and parenchymal thinning.</p>
  <p>Manifestations of neurogenic  bowel dysfunction may also become apparent. These include altered sensation of  stool in the anal vault and diminished external anal sphincter contractility.  This can present on a continuum ranging from constipation and encopresis to  diarrhea (Palmer 1997). The location of the injury determines which bowel symptoms  arise. Lower motor neuron (LMN) injuries, resulting from a lesion affecting  parasympathetic cell bodies (e.g. conus medullaris, cauda equina, or pelvic  nerves) diminish peristalsis.&nbsp; This leads  to slow stool propulsion, but also fecal incontinence due to denervation of the  external anal sphincter and levator ani muscles. Conversely, an upper motor  neuron (UMN) lesion above the conus medullaris will lead to bowels that are  hyper-reflexic. This manifests as dysregulated colonic motility with increased  anal tone, leading to constipation and fecal impaction (Paris 2011).<br><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</p>
  <p>URODYNAMIC  PROFILE:</p>
  <p>To help delineate any urologic  dysfunction in children with TCS, they should undergo formal urodynamic testing.  Detecting subclinical changes allows for untethering in advance of more  prominent neurologic symptoms (Vernet 1996). Palmer and colleagues found that  75% of TCS children demonstrate preoperative urodynamic findings that change  following detethering (Palmer 1998). Vernet and colleagues had similar success  with a sensitivity of 83% for detecting urological disturbances in patients  with secondary TCS following myelomeningocele repair (Vernet 1996). Urodynamic  studies are performed in the standard fashion for these children with a focus  on voiding cystourethrography, intra-abdominal and intravesical pressure,  sphincter electromyography and urethral pressure profilometry.&nbsp; The most common findings among children with  TCS include detrusor overactivity, decreased bladder compliance, detrusor  sphincter dyssynergia, and decreased sensation (Hertzler 2010) (Figure 5).&nbsp; Other sources have cited detrusor  hyperreflexia, decreased compliance, atonic bladder, and detrusor areflexia as  the most common findings in TCS patients (Fone 1997). &nbsp;Patients with primary tethered cord less than  3 years of age &nbsp;were found &nbsp;to have hypotonia as the most common  urodynamic finding (46.7%), followed by detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, high  voiding pressures, noncompliant bladder, and hyperreflexia (Macejko 2007). The  non-uniform use of terminology creates an issue comparing data between studies  (Fone 1997). Urodynamic profiles in infants and young children can at times be  difficult to interpret; infants, especially males, can have high voiding  pressures accompanied with physiologic discoordination of the detrusor  sphincter complex which matures with age (Bachelard 1999).<br>
    The majority of patients with TCS  will have a change in their urodynamic profile; however, the change is not  typically severe enough to produce clinical signs and symptoms (Palmer  1998).&nbsp; The concern over progressing  bladder dysfunction in this population is in the group of patients with high  intravesical pressures (Detrusor Leak Point Pressure &gt; 40 cm H2O) as this  has been shown to promote vesicoureteral reflux and subsequent upper tract  deterioration (McGuire 1981) (Figure 5). The purpose of urodynamic testing is  two-fold in that it provides a baseline measurement for which any deterioration  in function can be measured and, conversely, for which any improvement  following tethered cord release can be measured (Palmer 1998).</p>

  <p>RADIOGRAPHIC  STUDIES:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of imaging modalities such  as, MRI, ultrasound, and CT has been studied in patients with TCS to confirm  the diagnosis when clinical suspicion is high.&nbsp;  It will often times identify the level of the conus medullaris as well  as where the tethering is located.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As discussed earlier, the use of fetal  sonography and MRI may lead to a prenatal diagnosis of spinal cord dysraphism.  On sonography, vertebral body segmentation anomalies are indicated by a  &ldquo;jumbled-spine&rdquo; appearance. Additionally, closed versus open neural tube  defects may be detected and characterized. A myelocystocele can be identified  as a lumbosacral mass containing cerebrospinal fluid, neural tissue, and  adipose tissue. Lipomyelomeningocele, if present, may demonstrate a large  subcutaneous lumbar fatty mass in the absence of remarkable back deformity.  Other signs may be present that are difficult to visualize prenatally, such as  a sacral dimple or deviated gluteal fold. Open neural tube defects are almost  always seen prenatally on sonography, and associated Chiari 2 malformation and  hydrocephalus add certainty to the diagnosis (Sohaey 2009). Early recognition  of these findings will allow for a coordinated care effort at the time of the  delivery.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</strong></p>
  <p>In the postnatal period, magnetic  resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice in the evaluation of  tethered cord syndrome.&nbsp; MRI allows for  identification of the cause and provides adequate anatomical detail to allow  for surgical planning (Lew 2007).&nbsp; MRI is  capable of identifying meningoceles, myelomeningoceles, split cord  malformations, lipomatous and dermal tumors, thickened filum and sinus tracts  (Lew 2007, Hertzler 2010).&nbsp; Sagittal T1-  and T2-weighted images are best for localizing the level of the conus, whereas  axial T1-weighted images are best for determining the diameter and if fat is  present in the filum terminale (Bui 2007). Of note, patients that have  undergone a laminectomy will always to appear to have a tethered cord on MRI,  even in the absence of underlying pathology.</p>

  <p align="left">Figure 6:&nbsp; Axial T1 MRI showing a lipoma of the filum  terminale.</p>
  <p><strong>Ultrasound</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Ultrasound to evaluate for  tethered cord syndrome can be useful in infants.&nbsp; It allows for the evaluation of the cord  without subjecting the child to radiation.&nbsp;  It is most useful in children up to 6 months of age, but is most  sensitive before 3 months of life, after which there is a loss of an acoustic  window from the ossification of the spine (Singh 2012).&nbsp; In this age group, ultrasound is best able to  detect decreased spinal cord motion with its dynamic viewing, the presence of  fat and the level of the conus medullaris. Ultrasound is also used to monitor  the upper and lower urinary tracts as part of routine follow up. This permits  detection and monitoring of bladder wall thickness, presence of bladder  trabeculation, hydronephrosis, renal parenchymal thickness, and stones. The  2009 European Association of Urology guidelines suggest ultrasound of the upper  urinary tract and bladder every 6 months in patients with neurogenic lower  urinary tract dysfunction (Stohrer 2009).&nbsp;  Other recommendations have favored yearly renal sonography and urodynamic  examination in all children with myelomeningocele (Fone 1997).&nbsp; As an adjunct to ultrasound, a DMSA scan can  be considered for further evaluation of the upper urinary tract.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>Computed Tomography (CT)</strong></p>
  <p>Computed tomography or CT  myelography can be used if MRI is not available and was previously the standard  for diagnosis (Agarwalla 2007).&nbsp; Although  invasive and perhaps difficult to perform in young children, these modalities  do permit adequate anatomical detail of the spine and position of the conus  (Bui 2007).&nbsp; CT should be considered only  as a secondary option if MR imaging is inadequate or unavailable, as CT exposes  the patient to high radiation doses and children have a much greater risk of  developing radiation-induced cancer (Darge 2013); this is especially important  in these children as they will be subjected to multiple imaging studies over  the course of their lifetimes.</p>
  <p><strong>Abdominal X-Ray</strong></p>
  <p>Plain-film x-ray images also have  a role in the radiologic investigation of patients with tethered cord syndrome.  Plain films can assess associated bone malformations such as vertebral  anomalies or bone spurs (Caldarelli 2013). They are also particularly helpful  in characterizing spinal curvature and observing it over time (Agarwalla 2007,  Bui 2007).&nbsp; X-ray films may also be used  to detect renal or bladder calculi (Strouse 2002). In patients with neurogenic  bowel dysfunction, plain abdominal radiography is useful for evaluating the  degree and distribution of feces in the colon and helps to evaluate the success  of bowel management programs. It is also inexpensive and has significantly less  radiation compared to other imaging techniques (Park 2013).</p>

  <p>MANAGEMENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The natural history of tethered  cord syndrome is poorly understood due to the paucity of prospective trials  comparing conservative to surgical management.&nbsp;  Children with evidence of a tethered cord fit into either the  symptomatic or asymptomatic group.&nbsp; Children  presenting with neurologic or urologic symptoms related to their tethered cord  should undergo surgical treatment, however, the decision to operate on a child  who has evidence of tethered cord, but remains asymptomatic is less clear.&nbsp; It has been shown that in children who have  previously undergone surgical repair and developed re-tethering, the patients  developed urologic and orthopedic symptoms in 89% that required surgical  intervention (bladder augmentation, contracture release, spinal fusion) (Phuong  2002).&nbsp; The incidence of progression of  tethered cord syndrome as reflected by further orthopedic or urologic  procedures were 27.5, 40, and 60% at 1, 2, and 5 years respectively (Phuong  2002).&nbsp; In a review of 69 patients with  meningoceles that were treated surgically in the first 24 hours of life and  were followed for 5 years, 4% developed urologic signs as the initial  manifestations of tethered cord syndrome (Zerche 1997).&nbsp; A study by Satar et al showed that following  tethered cord release in older individuals, neurologic symptoms and urodynamic  profiles largely remained unchanged or even worsened in a few, concluding that older children and adults with  occult spinal dysraphism are more likely to present with irreversible  urological and neurological findings than younger children.&nbsp; Therefore, it is imperative that a diagnosis  be made and treatment be instituted as early as possible (Satar 1995).&nbsp; There are no credible reports of patients  with motor deficits, scoliosis, orthopedic deformities, or urologic dysfunction  spontaneously improving without surgical detethering and therefore, in patients  developing symptoms related to a tethered cord, there exists little likelihood  of symptomatic improvement without surgical detethering (Lew 2007).<br>
    Surgical detethering is based upon the etiology of the tethered cord with  the main goal of relieving the tension on the spinal cord.&nbsp; In cases of a thickened filum, the  recommended surgical approach is a simple sectioning of the filum  terminale.&nbsp; Spinal lipomas and lipomyelomeningoceles  are debulked and excised followed by a watertight dural closure.&nbsp; Dermal sinus tracts require full excision of  the sinus tract.&nbsp; More complicated  procedures are required for children with the various degrees of spina bifida,  but the primary endpoint remains, which is detethering with adequate dural  closure and minimal scarring.<br>
    The procedures for detethering the spinal cord do not come without  risks.&nbsp; Those include cerebrospinal fluid  leak, wound infections, neurological complications and re-tethering of the  cord.&nbsp; Symptomatic re-tethering of the  cord is a frequent complication of the detethering procedure and is more  frequent after repair of more complex spinal dysraphisms when some adherent  tissue is unable to be removed (Agarwalla 2007).&nbsp; The rates of re-tethering range from 5-50%  and are often a clinical diagnosis based on new urologic, neurologic or  orthopedic problems (Lew 2007).&nbsp; Many  surgical advances have been utilized to minimize the rate of re-tethering such  as changes in dural closures, hemostasis and intricate removal of the tethering  tissue.<br>
    Occult tethered cord as mentioned  previously, presents a diagnostic and management conundrum.&nbsp; In 1990, Khoury et al described children with  refractory urinary incontinence who following sectioning of the filum terminale  demonstrated the following results: 72% had improvement in incontinence; 59%  improvement in urodynamic detrusor hyperreflexia; and improvement in bladder  compliance in 66% of patients.&nbsp; Since  then there have been few additional small studies discussing sectioning of the  cord in cases of occult tethered cord syndrome. Management remains extremely  controversial due to the potential for worsening of symptoms in the absence of  radiological findings, however sectioning of the filum terminale has been  supported by retrospective reviews of small series (Fabiano 2009; Steinbok  2007; Guerra 2006; Metcalfe 2006; Selden 2006; Wehby 2004; Selcuki 2000; Nazar  1995; Warder 1993). &nbsp;Given the scarcity  of data on small patient populations in the absence of radiological findings, these  authors do not recommend routine sectioning of the filum unless circumstances  exceptional and even then parents must receive extensive counseling on  potential outcomes. <br>
    In addition to management of spinal abnormalities leading to TCS, medical  and surgical management may be necessary for the resulting neurogenic bowel and  bladder dysfunction. Where the patients have normal bladder and bowel function,  they can be followed closely to assess for deleterious changes. In patients  with signs and symptoms of a neurogenic bladder, the first step in management  is medical to address the inability of the bladder to empty effectively and  minimize the risk of bladder fatigue and scarring by dampening the detrusor  overactivity. Medical management of neurogenic bladder dysfunction incorporates  the use of anticholinergics and intermittent catheterization (CIC), and  reserves surgical treatment for bladder deterioration despite maximization of  medical management (Snodgrass 2010).&nbsp; In  the newborn or infant where bladder pressures are high and compliance poor  despite maximal medical therapy, then surgical intervention may be required. A  temporizing measure such as a vesicostomy can be done easily and with minimal  risk. This will allow the bladder to drain constantly and relieve pressure and  risk of injury to the upper tracts. Higher diversions may also occasionally  need to be performed. In the older child, bladder augmentation may be required  for management of the small contracted, &ldquo;hostile&rdquo; bladder with elevated  detrusor pressures and reduced compliance. Augmentation cystoplasty  incorporates the use of a bowel segment, usually ileum, to effectively increase  the capacity of the bladder. It also results in decreased detrusor pressures  and minimizes risk of deterioration of the upper tracts. This in conjunction  with a catheterization regimen has also demonstrated an 80% success rate in achieving  continence at a mean follow-up of 20 months (Snodgrass 2010). In many instances  a catheterizeable channel is developed at the same time as bladder augmentation  to facilitate emptying. Finally, a more recent surgical intervention includes  the injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder submucosa or detrusor  depending on the technique used, with the goal to avoid more aggressive surgery  while at the same time eliminating detrusor overactivity and decreasing high  pressures in the bladder. In essence the goal is to decrease the hostility of  the bladder.&nbsp; In this situation, and  where the bladder responds appropriately, the patient must be maintained on a  CIC regimen; otherwise the bladder will not empty unless the patient leaks at  low abdominal pressures. Most studies evaluating the duration of the effects of  botulinum toxin have found that success is short lived, with symptomatic  improvement lasting only 3-9 months before repeat injection is required. (Figueroa  2013; Game 2009; Altaweel 2006; Schulte-Baukloh 2005).<br>
    Sphincteric insufficiency, which may occasionally exist in these  situations, may affect the quality of life for the older child. However, it  does offer a protective advantage to the bladder and upper tracts, as leakage  at low abdominal leak point pressures minimizes the risk of developing high  detrusor leak point pressures. In the older child, where continence is desired,  however, a surgical procedure to increase bladder outlet resistance including  injection of a bulking agent, reconstruction with a sling, artificial urinary  sphincter, or bladder neck repair (wrap or revision) is required (Snodgrass  2010). Bladder outlet closure should be reserved <strong>until all else has failed</strong> and absolutely needs to be performed in conjunction with the creation of a continent  or incontinent channel (e.g., appendico-vesicostomy (Mitrofanoff), Monti, or ileal  chimney) to allow for bladder emptying. Bladder neck closure effectively  eliminates ready access to the bladder and any complications in the channel  created to drain the bladder are extremely difficult to manage and may increase  the risk of bladder perforation especially if this is done at the same time as  augmentation cystoplasty. It is this author&rsquo;s recommendation to avoid bladder  outlet closure at all costs.<br>
    Neurogenic bowel dysfunction can be managed conservatively with diet  modification, pharmacologic treatment, biofeedback, trans-anal  irrigation/enemas, massage, and electrical stimulation therapies. Pharmacologic  intervention depends on whether the patient is experiencing constipation or  incontinence. Constipation can be treated with bulking agents, stool softeners,  and osmotic and pro-kinetic agents. Irrigation can be used for constipation  refractory to conventional treatments. Where conservative measures fail,  surgical alternatives exist such as antegrade continence enemas (Malone  anterograde continence enema (MACE) or cecostomy tube), sacral root stimulator  implantations, graciloplasties, and artificial bowel sphincters (Paris 2011). A  MACE procedure allows for anterograde irrigation of the entire bowel and has a  high success rate of approximately 80% (Paris 2011). A MACE procedure is often  performed in conjunction with bladder augmentation and creation of a urinary  channel. Fecal incontinence can be treated with spinal cord, sacral, or  external simulation (Paris 2011). Palmer et al found that 68% of patients noted  significant improvement with a minimally invasive transrectal  electrostimulation technique. More recently bulking agents have been used with  greater success to assist with fecal continence where spincteric incontinence  exists (Leung 2011).&nbsp; A randomized trial  by Graf et al. showed a 50% reduction in incontinent episodes in 52% of the  treatment group compared to 31% in the sham group, follow up was 6 months (Graf  2011).&nbsp; This study and others were the  topic of a Cochrane review which highlighted the paucity of well-designed randomized  trials regarding fecal continence (Maeda 2013); there remains a lack of  consensus on the best material to use as a bulking agent.</p>
  <p>RESULTS FOLLOWING DETETHERING:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  results of surgical detethering for symptomatic tethered cord syndrome have  been shown to be favorable.&nbsp; In a review  of 114 children followed after tethered cord release, the most responsive  symptoms include pain, improved gait, improved lower extremity muscle strength  and stable lower extremity muscle contractures (Bowman 2009).&nbsp; These same results have been echoed by  several other studies examining children following tethered cord release.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urologic  response to detethering procedures is quite variable and is dependent on age  and pre-operative function.&nbsp; In a study  by Hsieh et al that examined urodynamic profiles in children before and after a  detethering procedure showed that of the subset of children with an abnormal  preoperative urodynamic profile, 50% showed improvement or normalization of the  profile and of those with a normal preoperative urodynamic profile, all  patients had a normal postoperative urodynamic profile (Hsieh 2006).&nbsp; In another study examining urodynamic  profiles pre and postoperatively, 35% of children had improvement in their  bladder dysfunction, while 5% deteriorated in their bladder dysfunction  (Abrahamsson 2007).&nbsp; While these results  seem promising, not all studies have shown dramatic improvements in urinary  function following detethering procedures.&nbsp;  A study by van der Meulen et al compared the outcomes of 4 groups of  patients; 1.) Detethering performed in asymptomatic children; 2.) Detethering  performed in children with progressively worsening symptoms; 3.) Detethering  following a period of conservative management; and 4.) Conservative  management.&nbsp; While the first group had  stable urological function during the period of follow up, which further  supports early detethering, the other groups showed mixed improvement,  stability and deterioration of function (van der Meulen 2002).&nbsp; A comparison of detethering in occult spinal  dysraphism versus secondary tethering showed that detethering improved urodynamic  findings in 62.5% in the occult spinal dysraphism groups, whereas the secondary  tethering group improved in 30% following detethering, but worsened in 48%  (Fone 1997).&nbsp; Due to the risk of  re-tethering of the cord, a study evaluating urologic outcomes following  multiple detethering procedures showed benefit regardless of the number of  previous detethering procedures (Al-Holou 2009).&nbsp; While improvement in urologic function is  variable, it is consistent that the earlier the tethered cord is released the  better the long term urologic function of the patient.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>CONCLUSIONS:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tethered  cord syndrome is a disorder of spinal cord movement, which results in a myriad  of symptoms affecting many organ systems.&nbsp;  While there are standards in place for the evaluation and management of  these patients, the care of the patients should be managed using a  multidisciplinary team approach which includes specialists from Urology, Neurosurgery,  and Orthopedic surgery. Early  management of the tethered cord offers the best opportunity to preserve/improve  long term urologic and bowel function. <br>
