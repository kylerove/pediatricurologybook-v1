  <p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong> </p>
  <p>International  Incontinence Society (ICS) has defined Urodynamic Studies as the evaluation of  function and malfunction of urinary tract (1). In general we understand that an  &ldquo;Urodynamic Study &ldquo;is a dynamic study of lower urinary tract but we cannot  forget&nbsp; that we must evaluate the whole  urinary tract&nbsp; including&nbsp; kidneys, ureter, bladder and urethra.</p>
  <p>To avoid this  confusion we will use the term cystometry to refer to the study of lower  urinary tract, including bladder function of filling, emptying and coordination  with the external urinary sphincter (2).Urodynamic Study of Lower Urinary Tract  can be done either invasively or non invasively.(2-3) (Figure 1).</p>
  <p>The modern  trend among paediatric urologists is to get a clinical approach to diagnosis  with an accurate clinical history and physical exam, and a voiding chart,  decreasing the number of children that need more complex and invasive exams. </p>
  <p>Better results  can be obtained if there is a multidisciplinary team with specialist trained  nurses. Ideally there should exist a special place where children feel  comfortable and relaxed, with proper equipment (videos, toys, ultrasound and  uroflowmetry) so it can avoid any kind of disturbance that can change the  results of the planned exams.<br><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

  <h1>Non Invasive Studies</h1>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Medical history is crucial.  It must be obtained in an appropriate place with enough time to get as much  information as possible. Every single detail is important, therefore it must be  asked, as it can make a big difference in the final management. </p>
  <p>Key points to  ask:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Urinary and Fecal Control Age.</li>
    <li>Voiding pattern</li>
    <li>Frequency</li>
    <li>Urge/Urge-incontinence</li>
    <li>Incontinence</li>
    <li>Fluid Intake</li>
    <li>Pregnancy and Perinatal Diseases</li>
    <li>Constipation / soiling</li>
    <li>Walking age</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Physical Exam  Key Points</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Palpable bladder</li>
    <li>Genital exam and anal reflexes</li>
    <li>Lumbo-sacral exam, searching for occult dysraphism</li>
    <li>Limbs exam to exclude neuropathy</li>
    <li>General Neurological Exam </li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Voiding Chart  also known as frequency-volume chary or bladder diary, is a simple, non  invasive record that reveals extremely useful information. (2,4). Ideally it  should consist of a record for a minimum of a 3 day period. The key points that  must be recorded are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Time of awakening and sleeping </li>
    <li>Fluid intake</li>
    <li>Voiding Frequency </li>
    <li>Voiding Volume </li>
    <li>Incontinence</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Urinary Tract Ultrasound  is essential. It can show either anatomical and/or functional diseases. Pre and  post void residuals should be recorded. It allows to evaluate anatomic characteristics  of the bladder (shape, thickness of the bladder wall, presence of  trabeculations) just like the pre and post voiding volume, that is extremely  useful information which added to uroflowmetry, gives a lot of information  about bladder functionality</p>
  <p>Uroflowmetry  is a non invasive examination, which gives a lot of information about bladder  emptying. The patient must pee in a proper seat for the child (Fig. 1) with a  device that records micturition, called a uroflowmeter. An ultrasound to  measure post voiding bladder volume must be also asked for. It can be done at  the same time as cystometry for the study of bladder emptying. (5)<strong></strong></p>
  <p>Uroflowmetry  can be done without a urinary catheter and only require that the child is potty  trained and can void on demand.&nbsp; It can  also record the external urethral sphincter activity with surface electrodes attached  to the perineum. Hence with this one test, the balder capacity, storage and  emptying characteristics and electromyography of the external sphincter/pelvic floor  and anterior abdominal wall can be assessed in a non invasive fashion.</p>
  <p>Normal  patients have a bell shape curve, with a maximal flow that changes with age and  gender (6-7). Baseline external urethral sphincter activity must diminish when  micturition begins, in that way, there won&acute;t be resistance to urine flow. (8)&nbsp; When it finished the post voiding volume of  bladder must be measured, with a bladder ultrasound or urethral catheter. Normal  post voiding volume must not exceed a 10% of pre voiding bladder volume (9).</p>
  <p>It is well  known that it is very difficult to fix normal values because all these depend on  gender, age, bladder capacity, etc. But it can establish the voiding volume,  frequency and voiding pattern (10). A bell shaped curve is considered normal,  but a flat one, with a prolonged urinary flow and a low flow rate is suggestive  of an obstructive pattern. A staccato flow (interrupted) may show, among  others, an uncoordinated contraction of detrusor and sphincter activity. Urinary  flow less than 10-12 ml/sec is considered abnormal , even when we know that  girls have increased frequency of micturition than boys. (11-12). As urinary  flows are variable, we recommend have three uroflow readings and calculate a  mean value.<strong> </strong></p>
  <p>Uroflowmetry allows  us to control the management of a low urinary tract obstruction due to  anatomical causes (PUV) or functional (after pelvic floor training). </p>
  <p>We must say  that with all this information it is possible to calculate and check the bladder  volume or its capacity, that could be calculated previously by several formulas  (13-14). Although there is not an ideal formula, it is necessary to determine  the bladder capacity consistently with the same formula; therefore team needs  to determine which one they will use, so it can evaluate and compare results over  time.<br><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

  <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
  <h1>Invasive (and complex) studies</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As a part of  urinary tract study there are nuclear medicine tests, scintigraphic studies such  as MAG3 and DMSA. They give anatomical and functional information. When you add  an indirect study to scintigraphy you can detect the presence of vesicoureteral  reflux (VUR). The study of lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) is called  cystometry and this tries to mimic as real as possible the micturition patterns  and the bladder behavior of an awake, non sedated and ideally, cooperative  child (2). It measures of intravesical, abdominal and detrusor pressures. It is  possible to complement this procedure with electromyography and uroflowmetry. Ideally  this study must be done under standard physical and psychological conditions  for the child so possible interferences can be avoided (15).</p>
  <p>Another resource to  avoid interferences is to perform a natural filling cystometry, installing 24  hrs previously a suprapubic one channel catheter (Cistofix&reg;). &nbsp;This technique allows the child -usually an  infant- to be in his/her mother&acute;s arms while he/she is doing any normal  activity, meanwhile the bladder is being filled naturally, the pressure through  the catheter can be recorded (16).<br>
    This technique  requires well trained operators and an adapted space because we must wait for  natural bladder&nbsp; filling which can be  slow. </p>
  <p>Traditionally,  this study has been done through a double channel catheter introducing a saline  solution into the bladder with a known flow, pretending to resemble the normal  filling phase and to evaluate the patient&acute;s micturition. This catheter can be  passed through the urethra or via the suprapubic route. The advantage of the  second method is that urethra and bladder emptying is not interfered by a  foreign body. &nbsp;On the other hand, a  urethral catheter prevents the need for the child to have a general anaesthetic  for suprapubic catheter insertion. The choice of which route to introduce the  dual lumen catheter depends on which of the filling, storage and emptying  phases is primarily being evaluated. If the urethral pressures or leak point  pressures are being evaluated prior to consideration of a bladder neck  procedure, a suprapubic route would be ideal. Also it is possible to insert a  bladder catheter through any continent diversion that the patient may have such  as a Mitrofanoff conduit.</p>
  <p>A cystometry  requires<strong> </strong>(Fig. 2)</p>
  <ol>
    <li>An adequate room</li>
    <li>A flowmeter&nbsp;  (ml/sec)</li>
    <li>Double channel catheter and rectal balloon &nbsp;<strong></strong></li>
    <li>Infusion pump</li>
    <li>Pressure transducers (cm H20)</li>
    <li>Electrodes patches for electromyography (mVolt)</li>
  </ol>
  Software to transform the information from this devices into curves that  are recorded into different channels that are exposed simultaneosly on the  screen.
  <p>Uroflowmetry  has already been explained. </p>
  <p>When we do a  polygraphic record with a cystomanometry, detrusor pressure during bladder  filling and bladder emptying are registered. To do this a double channel  catheter must be inserted as explained above. It is recommended that the fill  rate that must not exceed a 10% of known bladder capacity of the patient, taken  from a voiding diary, an ultrasound or a MUCG. It also must not exceed 10ml/min  (17). The second channel transmits intra vesical pressure to a transducer. This  information is translated by a software into a curve. If we use a suprapubic  catheter of one channel, the filling stage is given by the child&rsquo;s urine, and  the catheter records the pressure. </p>
  <p>If the fluid  that is used in the infusion is mixed with X-ray contrast, and the study can be  done in an X-Ray room, the procedure is called <strong>Video-Urodynamics</strong>. Thus,  it can be evaluated bladder shape, bladder neck shape and behavior, presence of  VUR, bladder dynamics, emptying dynamic, post voiding volume and double filling  of the bladder after an episode of VUR (18).</p>
  <p>As bladder  pressure is submitted to intra abdominal pressure, we need to know it and  discount it.&nbsp; The intra-abdominal  pressure is measured with a balloon inserted into the rectum or when available  through a distal enterostomy.&nbsp; This  balloon senses the changes of pressure to a transducer that, through a  software, records a second curve (1,19). The same software permanently calculates  differences between bladder and abdominal pressure to create a third curve that  records the detrusor pressure. </p>
  <p align="center"><strong>det P&deg; = blad P&deg; &ndash; abd P&deg; </strong></p>
  <p>In normal  conditions we expect that detrusor pressure remains low during the filling of  the bladder, with values under 10 cm H20. Bladder accommodates by the  viscoelastic properties of the wall and then, even when volume grows, pressure  remains stable (1).</p>
  <p>At some point  during the filling process, patient will have bladder fullness sensation, with  voiding desire, that will increase progressively until having an &nbsp;imminent voiding desire. At this time the pump  must be stopped and the patient allowed to micturate.</p>
  <p>During  voiding, must be observed if there is some degree of hesitancy or Valsalva&acute;s  maneuvers used to start micturition. Usually the patients start spontaneous voiding  with a detrusor contraction that is recorded as an increased and supported  value of 35 a 45 cm H20, associated to a bell shape voiding curve with  decreased electromyographic activity. At the end of micturition, we measure  post-voiding volume that must not exceed 10% of bladder capacity (3,5,19).</p>
  <p>Alterations that  can be seen in bladder filling stage are basically two (1): </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Detrusor over  activity or Overactive Bladder (OAB): Presence of Phasic Contractions or uninhibited  contractions, characterized by a sudden increase of detrusor pressure over 15  cm H20. It&acute;s the most common urodynamic alteration in children without  neurological disease.&nbsp; This causes Urge  and Urge- Incontinence symptoms. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Compliance  alterations:&nbsp; It refers to the inability  to maintain a low intravesical pressure during the filling stage.&nbsp; We see it as a progressive increase of  detrusor pressure that may &nbsp;alter or even  damage the upper urinary tract. This may be due to the high intravesical  pressure preventing urine passage &nbsp;to the  bladder or secondary vesicoureteral reflux.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Alterations  in bladder voiding stage are (1): </p>
  <p>1. Lower urinary tract obstructions It refers to anatomical or  functional disorder that increases resistance to urinary flow, and that, in a  very advanced stage, is characterized&nbsp; by  a plateau curve, associated a prolonged contraction of the detrusor muscle,  that in response, is trying to overcome the obstruction with or without an  elevation in intra-abdominal pressure. When dealing with a functional  obstruction this will show an increase in sphincter activity during voiding. These  patients can have enlarged post voiding residual volumes. </p>
  <p>2.  Detrusor Underactivity: This is a contraction of the detrusor that is weak,  absent or too short and that is inefficient to achieve complete bladder  emptying. Patients use Valsalva manoeuvres to facilitate bladder emptying,  recorded as increased abdominal pressure, and may present increased post  voiding residual volume. It can be due to a bladder outlet obstruction, with an  exhausted detrusor, or due to neurological disease. </p>
  <p>Cystometry in childhood  is different from adults because bladder dynamics is a changing process during  development and some alterations at some age, can be normal in others. (like overactivity  in infants) (20). Bladder capacity also will change, and the patient will be able  to keep bigger volumes inside the bladder as he/she grows. There are some  pathologies such overactive bladder (OAB), that might limit bladder&acute;s growing  due to frequent emptying as a result of the un inhibited contractions.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    Actually it is  possible to do cystometry studies at night, with one channel catheter, watching  nocturnal bladder behavior. Also it is possible to perform Holter Cystometry (8,16)  recording bladder pressure over a predetermined time, with the child at home,  recording a voiding diary. All these attempt to explore bladder in its own  environment, in the most natural way possible, and may give&nbsp; more useful information.</p>
  <p>Guided by non  invasive tests and where appropriate, other resources to complete the  urodynaimc study are Computed Axial Tomography, Magnetic Nuclear and Whitaker test or urodynamic test of  upper urinary tract. (3).<br>
    The image  studies (MNR and CT scan) exceed the objectives of this chapter and the  Whitaker test has lost popularity in time, been replaced for new less invasive  studies. </p>
  <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Urodynamic  Studies embrace the whole Urinary Tract, and must be considered in the  armamentarium of urological practice. Simple&nbsp;  non invasive urodynamics (iary, uroflowmetry and ultrasound) &nbsp;allow us to guide diagnosis and treatment in  the majority of urological patients reducing the need for invasive urodynamics  for more complex children with incontinence such as patients with anorectal  malformations, posterior urethral valves, bladder exstrophy or spinal  dysraphism (2,5). <br>
    Interpretation  of a urodynamic study requires experience. &nbsp;These studies require time, patience and the  contribution of child and family and requires their involvement with the  multidisciplinary team. <br>
