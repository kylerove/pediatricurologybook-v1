  <p><strong>Hydronephrosis</strong><br>
    <strong>Definition</strong><br>
Hydronephrosis is defined as dilatation of the renal pelvis  and/or calyces1. It may occur as  a result of impairment of urine flow or the retrograde flow of urine. <br>
<strong>Classifications</strong><br>
Confusingly, different methods of classifying the severity  of hydronephrosis on ultrasound are used either side of the Atlantic2. In North  America, the SFU classification 3 has been adopted  as the gold standard4. SFU Grade 1 describes  a spilt renal pelvis. Grade 2 refers to further dilatation of the renal pelvis  with a few calyces being visualized. Grade 3 is renal pelvic dilatation with  many distended calyces, and with additional thinning of the renal parenchyma  representing Grade 4. However, the subjectiveness of assessing the appearance  of the calyces, renal pelvis and parenchyma results in significant  inter-observer variation especially for the higher grades of hydronephrosis5. In Europe, the  more objective method of measuring the anterior-posterior pelvic diameter in  the transverse plane is employed6, combined with a  still subjective description of the degree of calyceal dilatation and quality  of the parenchyma.<br>

<strong>Antenatally  diagnosed hydronephrosis</strong><br>
In utero,  hydronephrosis is defined as fetal renal pelvic diameter <u>&gt;</u>5 mm in the  second trimester and <u>&gt;</u>7 mm in the third trimester6,7. Urine formation is thought to begin between  the 5th and 8th weeks of gestation8. At 20 weeks, the fetus produces  approximately 5cc of urine per hour and by the 40th week this  increases to 50cc per hour. The fetal bladder can be observed to empty on  ultrasound by the 15th week. The bladder capacity which is  approximately 10cc at 30 weeks increases to 50cc at term. <br>
Antenatally diagnosed  dilatation of the urinary tract can result from either impairment of urine flow  or retrograde reflux of urine. Urine flow impairment can occur at any level in  the urinary tract, and may affect one or both sides. Dilatation of the renal  pelvis and calyces is the first anatomical response to impairment of urine flow  and may lead to histological damage of the renal parenchyma and changes in  renal function. Histological damage is related to the degree and level of urine  flow impairment and its duration. Renal atrophy, as seen in patients with  multicystic dysplastic kidney, is the ultimate response to impairment of urine  flow related to the onset of apoptosis9 (Figure 1). When urine flow impairment is  present early in pregnancy, the renal parenchyma develops dysplasia10, and in severe cases there is a reduction of  the ipsilateral glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Where outflow of urine from  both kidneys is markedly impaired, this will result in fetal oliguria or  anuria. While fetal urine is not a major contributor to amniotic fluid volume  in the first trimester, oliguria or anuria thereafter leads to oligo- or  anhydramnios7. When urine flow impairment becomes  significant later in gestation or is partial, it generates dilatation of the  excretory system without affecting the parenchymal structure11,12. </p>

  <p><br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Natural History</strong><br>
In the past, the management of hydronephrosis  was straight forward because children presented with symptoms, particularly infection  or pain, which warranted operation. Today congenital anomalies of the kidney  and urinary tract (CAKUT) are increasingly detected by antenatal ultrasound, with  1:850 pregnancies13 having an antenatally detected urinary tract anomaly (AUTA)14.  The advances in ultrasound technology and the resultant identification of large  numbers of asymptomatic upper tract dilatations have forced physicians to alter  their understanding of the significance of hydronephrosis. Long term natural  history studies show that dilatation often improves or resolves spontaneously15,16; hydronephrosis is not synonymous with obstruction17,18.<br>
<strong>Postnatal assessment  of the neonate with antenatal hydronephrosis</strong><br>
When antenatal  hydronephrosis is discovered, it is imperative to confirm the diagnosis  postnatally. Knowledge of the prenatal evaluations during the progression of  pregnancy forms the starting point of the assessment of the newborn19. The degree of unilateral or bilateral  hydronephrosis, ureteric dilatation, renal size and parenchymal appearance,  visualization and size of the fetal bladder as well as the amniotic fluid  volume in relation to gestational age are the key facts to obtain from  antenatal ultrasound7. The likelihood of significant postnatal  pathology correlates to the severity of antenatal hydronephrosis20.<br>
<strong><em>Clinical examination:</em></strong><br>
A thorough physical examination of  the neonate is required. This may reveal a palpable abdominal mass in neonates  with an uretero-pelvic junction anomaly (UPJA), multicystic dysplastic kidney  (MCDK), autosomal-recessive polycystic kidney disease and in congenital bladder  outflow obstruction, such as posterior urethral valves (PUVs) and urethral  atresia19. Urinary tract abnormalities can occur secondary to other  congenital anomalies, for example, neural tube defects, and feature in many  chromosomal anomalies and syndromes21. For instance, deficient abdominal wall musculature with bilateral  cryptorchism raises the possibility of prune-belly syndrome, whereas anorectal  or esophageal atresia may point to the VACTERL association (vertebral  anomalies, anal atresia, cardiovascular anomalies, tracheo-esophageal fistula, esophageal  atresia, renal and/or radial anomalies, limb defects). Secondary effects of  oligohydramnios &ndash; due to oliguria or anuria in the second half of pregnancy &ndash;  may be present, culminating in the Potter sequence or talipes19. Whilst the appearance of the open bladder in the anterior  abdominal wall in vesical exstrophy is striking, other CAKUT may have no  obvious manifestations on physical examination. A postnatal ultrasound is  therefore necessary.<br>
<strong><em>Investigations:</em></strong><br>
Postnatal ultrasound should be done  after day 2 or 3 of life22 because ultrasonography earlier than this can lead to a false-negative  result23, due to the relative oliguria of the newborn period6. If no abnormality is detected, a repeat ultrasound scan  is advisable at 6 weeks of age19,20. The ultrasound  evaluation must comprise images of the bladder including the bladder wall  thickness and the presence of dilated ureters or ureteroceles, prone views of  the kidneys for accurate measurement of the renal length and the renal pelvic  diameter in the anterior&ndash;posterior plane, as well as an assessment of calyceal  dilatation and the renal parenchyma6. An algorithm for the investigation of the neonate with antenatal  hydronephrosis is provided below.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An early postnatal ultrasound is  essential for all fetuses with bilateral hydronephrosis &gt;20 mm or  hydronephrosis &gt;20 mm in a solitary kidney. Many of these neonates require  referral to a pediatric urologist. Early ultrasound, ideally between day 3 and  7 of life, is also recommended where details of the prenatal history are  incomplete or a reliable late third-trimester scan is missing. Ultrasound  assessment of the neonate with antenatal unilateral or bilateral hydronephrosis  &gt;15 mm, with or without ureteric dilatation, is advised in the first 7&ndash;10  days of life. These babies require antibiotic prophylaxis. <br>
For the remainder (antenatal  hydronephrosis &gt;7 mm in the second trimester and/or &gt;10 mm in the third  trimester, but less than 15 mm) an ultrasound can be performed in the first 2&ndash;3  weeks of life, and antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended. Instead, parents  should be given information about the signs of UTI and advised to seek help  early if their baby develops such signs. <br>
If the postnatal ultrasound scan  shows unilateral renal pelvic dilatation, no further investigations need to be  done until 4&ndash;6 weeks of age. Isotope renography can then be performed at 4&ndash;12  weeks, when the kidneys have matured sufficiently for this to be reliable. As a  guide, we advocate a MAG3 study at 4 weeks for hydronephrosis &gt;30 mm, at 4&ndash;6  weeks for hydronephrosis &gt;20 mm and at 3 months for hydronephrosis of 15&ndash;20  mm and 10&ndash;15 mm with calyceal dilatation. Bilateral dilatation in boys requires  an early voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to exclude bladder outlet obstruction.<br>
The role of the VCUG in neonates  with unilateral dilatation is less well established, and there is still  controversy20.  Initially it was felt that all babies with pelvic dilatation of any degree  required a VCUG in order to exclude reflux, which is present in approximately  15&ndash;20%24. More recent studies have questioned the clinical significance of  this reflux. We, like many other centers25, advocate performing a VCUG only in patients with bilateral or  unilateral hydronephrosis &gt;10 mm in a solitary kidney, with a dilated ureter  or where there is a suspicion of an abnormal bladder. A VCUG is not necessary  when there is unilateral hydronephrosis and a normal contralateral kidney.  Others, however, still recommend that a VCUG is done in all cases where  significant hydronephrosis persists postnatally19,26.  Babies should receive treatment dose antibiotics (Trimethoprim 4 mg/kg bd) on  the day of the VCUG and on the subsequent 3 days, to prevent the complication  of infection. <br>
<strong><em>Prophylactic antibiotics:</em></strong><br>
The use of prophylactic antibiotics  is also debated20,27,28. While some units advocate their use in all neonates undergoing  investigation for antenatal hydronephrosis26,27, others advise that  instead of routine prophylaxis families should be educated on the signs and  symptoms of UTI to enable prompt diagnosis and treatment if infection occurs19. We advocate prophylactic trimethoprim at 2 mg/kg nocte initially  for all neonates who fulfill the criteria for VCUG, and subsequently for those  who are found to have &nbsp;grade III to V vesicoureteric  reflux (VUR), in the absence of VUR but presence of ureteric dilatation &gt;10  mm, and for those with hydronephrosis &gt;20 mm.<br>
<strong>Underlying etiologies </strong><br>
Following the initial newborn and  6&ndash;12-week investigations, a diagnosis can be made in the majority of infants.  The table below lists the most common renal parenchymal anomalies and causes of  dilatation, which may co-exist. The individual diagnoses are discussed in the following chapters. </p>

  <p><strong>Uretero-pelvic junction anomaly (UPJA or PUJA)</strong><strong> </strong><br>
Definition<br>
A pelvi-ureteric  junction anomaly is defined as impairment to the flow of urine from the renal  pelvis into the ureter causing pathological dilatation of the renal pelvis and  calyces, and culminating in progressive renal damage. The diagnosis of UPJA can  be suspected when an ultrasound scan shows a dilated renal pelvis without ureteric  dilatation and a normal bladder6,7. <br>
<strong>Incidence</strong><br>
UPJA is the most  common antenatally-diagnosed urinary tract anomaly29,30, accounting for approximately half of all  antenatal hydronephrosis15. The left side is more commonly affected  than the right at a ratio of 2:11. UPJA is bilateral in 10% to 20% of cases  and is twice to three times as common in males than females7,31.<strong> </strong><br>
<strong>Etiology</strong><br>
The majority of UPJA  is primary and congenital in origin, although the problem may not become  clinically apparent until much later in life. <br>
<strong><em>Primary UPJA - Intrinsic:</em></strong>Congenital UPJA is typically characterized  histologically by abnormal fibromuscular and neural arrangements at the UPJ32, interfering with the normal peristalsis of  urine at this point (see pathophysiology). <br>
<strong><em>Extraluminal:</em></strong><strong> </strong>Alternatively or additionally, extrinsic  compression of the UPJ, which may be intermittent, can result from, for  instance, aberrant vessels crossing to the lower pole of the kidney7. Occasionally, the ureter can be compressed  by the inferior vena cava or distorted by the isthmus of a horseshoe kidney.  Even so, an intrinsic etiology remains more common in a horseshoe kidney with  UPJA than distortion by its isthmus.<br>
<strong><em>Intraluminal:</em></strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>Obstruction  by stones or fibro-epithelial polyps is uncommon in children.<br>
<strong><em>Secondary UPJA:</em></strong>In severe cases of vesico-ureteric reflux,  the ureter may become extremely tortuous and kink on itself producing a  secondary UPJA. Scarring following previous surgery or impacted stones may  result in a stricture at the UPJ.<br>
<strong>Genetics</strong><br>
Congenital UPJA appears sporadic  and only half a dozen families with a high incidence of hydronephrosis have  previously been reported in the literature: linkage to the HLA region of  chromosome 6 was identified in some but not in other families33.  As for other CAKUT34,35,  genetic heterogeneity in congenital UPJA should be anticipated in view of our  realization of the complexity of the regulatory signaling networks involved in  ureterogenesis. <br>
<strong>Embryology</strong><br>
Metanephric  mesenchyme signals to the ureteric bud to initiate its outgrowth from the  posterior aspect of the mesonephric duct into the metanephric blastema36 in the 5th week of gestation. The  ureteric bud gives rise to the epithelium of the renal pelvis and ureter - the  urothelium - and branches repeatedly to form the collecting ducts. The  collecting duct tips induce metanephric mesenchymal cell aggregation and  mesenchymal-to-epithelial transformation for nephron formation. Mesenchymal  cells surrounding the stalk of the ureteric bud develop into the cells of the  lamina propria, smooth muscle and connective tissue of the renal pelvis and  ureter. Reciprocal signaling between the epithelial and mesenchymal components  of the renal pelvis and ureter is essential for their correct development.  While canalization of the ureter is achieved by the end of embryogenesis,  maturation of the ureteric wall continues well beyond birth, which may explain  the spontaneous improvement or resolution of many antenatally detected  hydronephroses7.<br>

  <p><strong>Molecular control</strong><br>
The molecular control of normal  ureterogenesis is only beginning to be unraveled37,38. As developmental processes and  their genes are highly conserved between species, animal models are  contributing greatly to our knowledge.&nbsp;  More and more genes expressed during normal urinary tract development  are being identified, mostly from work on the mouse39,40.  Different techniques are being employed to explore the function of these genes,  including in vitro cell and organ culture  experiments, and mouse mutants with specific gene knock-outs. The  identification of particular mutations in corresponding human genes in some  children with urinary tract malformations39,40  is providing further insight. </p>
  <p>So  far, several regulatory networks have been suggested for ureteric development,  which may interconnect or operate in parallel. For instance, Airik et al41  have suggested an independent role for the transcription factor T-box 18 (Tbx18)  on Wnt signaling and on a cascade involving sonic hedgehog (Shh) &ndash;  Patched142 &ndash;  bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4)43. The  highly conserved gene, Teashirt 3 (Tshz3), which encodes a transcription  factor, may act downstream or as a permissive co-factor to the Shh  pathway, and has effects on retinoic acid signaling and on myocardin36,37. Mouse  ureteric smooth muscle precursors express Tshz3. Teashirt  3 null mutant mice have congenital hydronephrosis without anatomical  obstruction: increasing hydronephrosis is preceded by failed ureteric smooth  muscle differentiation, and ex vivo, their ureters lack peristalsis36.  Furthermore, a TSHZ3 coding variant appears to be a  risk factor for human congenital UPJA36,  thereby inferring a genetic etiology for this condition. Null mutants for  discs-large homologue 1 (Dlgh1)44,  angiotensin type 1 receptor (Agtr1)45 or  inactivation of its potential downstream effecter gene calcineurinB1 (Cnb1)  in urinary tract mesenchyme46,  also demonstrate defective pelvi-ureteric smooth muscle, with failure of  peristalsis resulting in progressive hydronephrosis. </p>
  <p>Pathophysiology <br>
Our understanding of the  pathophysiology of congenital UPJA remains rudimentary. The lack of an  anatomical blockage in the ureter paired with an abnormal smooth muscle and  neural arrangement at the UPJ32,47,  have resulted in the concept of a &ldquo;functional&rdquo; obstruction. The normal ureter  propels urine from the renal pelvis to the bladder through unidirectional  peristaltic contractions triggered by pacemaker cells48,  while preventing reflux. Failure of this peristaltic mechanism is thought to  cause hydronephrosis through ineffective urine flow46. The intrinsic compliance  of the collecting system initially attempts to avoid pressure rises by  accommodating the accumulating urine through dilatation. However, persisting  urine flow impairment eventually results in hypertrophy of the renal pelvis  with loss of compliance and rising pressure within the collecting system.  Changes in renal function follow. In general terms, obstruction in early  gestation impairs renal growth and differentiation, producing small dysplastic  kidneys. Later, it generates primarily a dilated system7 with progressive stretching of the renal cortex preceding  histological and functional changes. The key in congenital UPJA is to identify  the ones which will progress to renal deterioration, if left untreated, from  those which will spontaeously improve or resolve over time. <br>
<strong>Clinical features</strong><br>
Although many UPJA are diagnosed on  prenatal ultrasound, some still present as problems in infancy and beyond.  Abdominal mass was one of the principal symptoms of UPJA in babies before the  ultrasound era49. Loin or renal-angle pain reflects more acute distension of the  renal pelvis, and can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A detailed history may  reveal that the pain correlates with periods of increased fluid intake or  ingestion of a food with diuretic properties (i.e. Dietl crisis), or  intermittent compression of the UPJ, for instance, by lower pole crossing  vessels. Pyelonephritis/pyonephrosis and sepsis, haematuria, and hypertension  are less common presentations of UPJA.<br>
<strong><em>Associated anomalies</em></strong><br>
Associated urological anomalies  include ureteric hypoplasia50, VUR51,52, VUJ  anomaly, partial or complete ureteric duplication53,54 and  horseshoe kidney. UPJA can be associated with anorectal anomaly, congenital  heart disease and VATER syndrome55.</p>
  <p>Investigations<br>
An algorithm for the  assessment of the newborn with antenatally detected hydronephrosis is provided  earlier in this chapter. <br>
<strong>Laboratory studies</strong><br>
<strong><em>Serum Biochemistry</em></strong><br>
In the presence of a normal  contra-lateral kidney, serum electrolytes, bicarbonate, urea and creatinine  usually suffice. Those with bilateral urinary tract abnormalities may require  more accurate assessment of overall renal function by measurement of the  glomeruler filtration rate (GFR).<br>
<strong><em>Urine Microbiology</em></strong><br>
Whenever the possibility of  infection complicating an UPJA is entertained, urine should be sent promptly  for microscopy, culture and sensitivity.<br>
<strong><em>Urinary Biomarkers</em></strong><br>
In view of the difficulty  in identifying those with obstruction at risk of renal loss from those who will  undergo spontaneous resolution, urine is being researched to identify reliable  biomarkers for UPJ obstruction. Both proteomic patterns and specific proteins  are being explored. So far, decreased levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and  increased levels of transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta-1), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase  (NAG), monocyte chemotactic peptide-1 (MCP-1) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) have been  reported in UPJA56.&nbsp; However, further studies are needed to  ascertain their role in routine clinical practice.<br>
<strong>Radiology</strong><br>
Serial imaging is central  in the investigation of UPJA, in order to differentiate between those  undergoing gradual resolution and those at risk of renal loss. The  investigations are repeated at intervals in order to determine whether any  changes have taken place, such as increasing hydronephrosis and/or reducing  differential renal function to prompt surgical intervention. Ultrasound and  functional imaging also help to ascertain the success of surgery.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Ultrasound</em></strong><br>
The diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral UPJA can  be suspected on ultrasound when this shows renal pelvic dilatation without  ureteric dilatation and a normal urinary bladder6,7. As discussed earlier, different  classifications for the degree of hydronephrosis are employed either side of  the Atlantic. Nevertheless, both systems require assessment of renal pelvis and calyceal dilatation  (figure 2).<br>
Information  to be obtained from the renal ultrasound should include:<br>
1. &nbsp;&nbsp; the  location, size and morphology of each kidney,<br>
2. &nbsp;&nbsp; an  exact measurement of the renal pelvic diameter in mm in the antero-posterior  plane, <br>
3. &nbsp;&nbsp; the  degree of calyceal dilatation,<br>
4. &nbsp;&nbsp; parenchymal  abnormalities, such as renal cortical thinning, lack of cortico-medullary  differentiation, cystic changes,<br>
5. &nbsp;&nbsp; indicate  unilateral or bilateral pathology, and<br>
6.  &nbsp;&nbsp; views of the ureters and bladder  including measurement of the bladder volume. In those able to void on volition,  a pre- and post-micturition bladder volume should be recorded (figure 3).<br>

  <p><em>Doppler  Ultrasound</em><br>
In experienced hands,  Doppler scanning may permit demonstration of lower pole crossing vessels in a  co-operative child. <br>

  <p><strong><em>Renal scintigraphy</em></strong><br>
Historically, IVP was used  to evaluate patients with possible UPJA. Today, diuretic renography has taken  the place of IVP in the evaluation of a child with a hydronephrotic kidney  (figure 4). The benefits of diuretic renography are that iodine-based  intravenous contrast is not needed, radiation exposure is minimal, and differential  renal function can be better quantified. The disadvantage of the nuclear  medicine scan is that insight into renal anatomy is not obtained.<br>
<img width="176" height="118" src="hydronephrosis_upja_clip_image002_0002.jpg"><img width="198" height="118" src="hydronephrosis_upja_clip_image004_0000.jpg"><br>
<strong><em>Figure  4:</em></strong> <em>Mercaptotriglycylglycine (MAG-3)  in an infant with antenatal right hydronephrosis. After 12 months of  observation, the previously stable hydronephrosis increased, prompting a repeat  Mag3 and pyeloplasty. The Mag3 demonstrated equal differential function, but  while complete drainage was observed on the left following change in posture  and micturition, on the right tracer persisted in the dilated renal pelvis. </em></p>
  <p><em>Mercaptotriglycylglycine  (MAG-3)</em><br>
Diuretic renography with mercaptotriglycylglycine  is the most popular functional imaging modality in UPJA. Precise protocols for  Mag3 renography in children have been established by the European Association  of Nuclear Medicine57 and the North American Society of Nuclear Medicine58.<br>
Mag3 renography allows estimation of differential  renal clearance through the extraction of tracer from the blood, as well as  observations on excretion through the urinary tract by the disappearance of the  tracer. <br>
Differential renal function is best assessed  between 1 and 2 minutes, and normally ranges between 45-55%. Of note, in  ectopic kidneys, Mag3 underestimates differential renal function, and DMSA is  advised in this situation. <br>
Assessment of drainage is controversial. The  classical method of analyzing the shape or slope of the washout curve after  furosemide is prone to error. The slope will differ for a well-functioning and  a poorly-functioning kidney and the shape of the curve will vary for different  volumes of the pelvi-calyceal system57. <br>
Good drainage is easy to define, as the images,  curves and numerical data all show little tracer in the pelvicaliceal system at  the end of the study. However, the definition of impaired drainage and its  significance has been strongly debated for the last decades57. The sequential one minute  images should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with the curves and  quantification data. The percentage of activity which has left the renal  compartment during the time interval studied - pelvic excretion efficiency  (PEE) or output efficiency (OE) &ndash; can be quantified in relation to the heart  curve59.<br>
&nbsp;Post-micturition images can take into account  the effect of bladder emptying and gravity. Again, this can be quantified:  normalised residual activity (NORA) expresses the residual activity after  micturition as a percentage of the renal activity 2 minutes after tracer  injection60. <br>
Nevertheless, the following caveats remain:  impaired drainage does not necessarily indicate obstruction. Poor hydration and  poor overall renal function make accurate estimation of both differential  function and drainage impossible. In a grossly hydronephrotic kidney,  conclusions on poor drainage is precarious as this may reflect hold-up or  simply on-going filling of the capacious system. Sequential renography  documenting changes in differential function may therefore be needed to  identify those with obstruction, defined by Koff and Campbell16 as a restriction to urine  flow which if left untreated will cause progressive renal deterioration. <br>
<em>Dimercaptosuccinic  acid (DMSA)</em><br>
99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid  binds to the proximal convoluted tubule. Intra-venous injection is followed by  image acquisition 2-3 hours later61. Today, DMSA provides the  most accurate relative function of the kidneys and is the investigation of  choice for renal parenchymal anomalies. As discussed above, the differential  function estimated by Mag3 is inaccurate in those with poor overall renal  function and in ectopic kidneys, and DMSA is advised. In cases of reduced  differential function to around 15%, DMSA can help to clarify the choice  between pyeloplasty and nephrectomy. </p>
  <p><em>Diethylenetriamine  (DTPA)</em><br>
99mTc diethylenetriamine has a  low renal extraction rate and instead depends on filtration. The kidney of  young infants is still immature and renal clearance progressively increases  until approximately 2 years of age. In young children, this results in high  background activity and poor kidney-to-background ratio for DTPA, and Mag3 is  thus preferred61. <br>
<strong><em>Magnetic resonance  urography (MRU)</em></strong><br>
The advantages of acquiring  both anatomical and functional information of the urinary tract in a single  study without ionizing radiation make dynamic contrast-enhanced MRU with  gadolinium-DTPA an ideal imaging modality for children. Details of renal  vasculature, including lower pole crossing vessels, renal cortical morphology,  and renal pelvic and ureteric anatomy can be obtained. However, the methodology  for functional analysis continues to be developed and protocols for their  interpretation are still being validated. Furthermore, as sedation or general  anaesthesia is generally needed for MRU in children under the age of 6 years,  its use is for the most part limited to complex anomalies of the urinary tract. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Fluoroscopy</em></strong><br>
As discussed earlier,  voiding cysto-urethrogram (VCUG) is only indicated in boys with bilateral  hydronephrosis, in the presence of ureteric dilatation or an abnormal bladder. <br>
<em>Intravenous  urogram (IVU)</em><br>
As explained before, this  has been largely superseded by the above imaging modalities.<br>
<em>Retrograde  ureteropyelography</em><br>
Retrograde  ureteropyelography, via cystoscopy, is sometimes indicated to clarify ureteric  anatomy. For instance, it may allow differentiation between UPJ and VUJ  anomalies where this was unclear on pre-operative imaging. Similarly, an  additional VUJ anomaly may be identified in this manner prior to pyeloplasty. <br>
<em>Antegrade  pyelography</em><br>
In difficult cases,  puncture of the renal collecting system allows observation of the flow of  contrast through the UPJ. Whitaker tried to refine the antegrade study by  measuring pressure during installation of saline into the renal pelvis at a constant  rate. Unfortunately, results obtained correlate poorly with &ldquo;obstruction&rdquo;  defined by other means, and hence the Whitaker test is rarely used today  (figure 5).<br>
<img src="hydronephrosis_upja_clip_image002_0003.jpg" alt="figure4" width="78" height="102"><br>
<strong><em>Figure  5:</em></strong><em> Antegrade pyelogram of a left kidney  demonstrating a dilated renal pelvis with clubbed calyces. Note the marked  change at the UPJ, with small amounts of contrast passing into a non-dilated  ureter below, thereby confirming the diagnosis of UPJA.</em></p>
  <p>For those presenting with pain or  infection, the aim of treatment is the relief of symptoms caused by the  impairment of urine flow across the uretero-pelvic junction. The goal for  asymptomatic UPJA is the prevention of loss of renal function.&nbsp; As discussed above, hydronephrosis does not  equate with obstruction. The majority of infants with antenatally detected  renal pelvic dilatation improve spontaneously. In others, however, the restriction to urine flow  across the UPJ will cause progressive renal deterioration15,16,62,63. The management of  asymptomatic UPJ anomaly is thus a balance between preventing renal  deterioration on the one hand, and avoiding unnecessary surgery and its  complications on the other. Who benefits from an operation can only be decided  after a period of regular assessment16,17,64, with the degree of hydronephrosis during the second and  third trimesters of pregnancy acting as the starting point.<strong> </strong>Approximately 25% of antenatal hydronephrosis  due to UPJA will require surgical intervention15, usually within the first few years of life15,17,64.<br>
Close observational management of a  baby with unilateral UPJA, as initially proposed by Ransley et al62, is justified, if:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>the infant is  asymptomatic,</li>
    <li>the degree of pelvic  dilatation, measured with repeated ultrasound, is stable or decreasing, and</li>
    <li>the relative function  of the affected kidney (measured with radioisotope studies) is either stable or  improving. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Many centers recommend  prophylactic antibiotic cover27, although no studies have to date proved  that it prevents UTI.<br>
    Surgical treatment is advocated by most in  the following circumstances: <br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; presence of symptoms,<br>
    2. &nbsp;&nbsp; declining function in the dilated kidney15-17,64, <br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; increasing pelvic dilatation15-17,64, <br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moderate pelvic dilatation (&gt;20 mm) with  dilatation of the calyces15,22, <br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bilateral moderate  to severe dilatation of the pelvis15.<br>
    These indications are  not accepted by all: some operate on all infants during the first year of life,  arguing that the outcome of pyeloplasty is usually excellent in terms of  drainage and preserved renal function65. Conversely, others will follow a  conservative approach even with severe pelvic dilatation16,17,64. When surgery is performed, the most common  operation is a pyeloplasty.<br>
  <strong>Percutaneous nephrostomy</strong><br>
    Acute presentation  with pyonephrosis requires prompt drainage by percutaneous nephrostomy for  renal salvage, followed by pyeloplasty once the infection has settled for those  with preserved renal function. <br>
    Temporary diversion  of the pelvic urine via a percutaneous nephrostomy for 3&ndash;4 weeks may also be  considered to assess whether renal function may be partially recovered in a  poorly functioning, severely dilated kidney62. However, Ransley et al62 never observed improvement of function in kidneys  with &lt;10% differential function initially. Nephrectomy is therefore  recommended for infants with severe pelvic dilatation and very poor relative  function (&lt;10%) in the presence of a normal contralateral kidney15.<br>
  <strong>Pyeloplasty</strong><br>
    The surgical  principles for pyeloplasty are the formation of a tension-free funnel-shaped  anastomosis which is water-tight and enables dependent drainage. In children,  the procedure of choice is a dismembered repair, as described by Anderson and  Hynes, which allows excision of the typically fibrotic and stenotic UPJ  segment. Success rates exceed 95%. <br>
  <strong><em>Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty</em></strong><br>
    The kidney can be  reached by either an anterior extraperitoneal, flank or dorsal lumbotomy  appraoch. By following the lower pole of the kidney medially the surgeon is  guided to the UPJ. The ureter is slooped and dissected distally for a  tension-free repair. Adventitia is cleared off the UPJ and renal pelvis. Stay  sutures are then placed on the renal pelvis and the renal pelvis cut for a dependent  anastomosis. The ureter is spatulated so as to ensure a wide anastomosis. In  the presence of lower pole crossing vessels, the anastomosis is fashioned  anterior to the vasculature. Whether to place a temporary nephro-ureteric or JJ  stent is based on surgeon preference. A recent meta-analysis documented 95%  success rates for the procedure with or without stenting, and external stents  were found to be more cost-effective than no stents or internal JJ stents66. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Laparoscopic pyeloplasty</em></strong> <br>
Laparoscopic pyeloplasty is  growing in popularity. The laparoscopic approach is especially attractive for  ectopic or abnormal kidneys, such as for instance a horseshoe kidney. However,  it is a technically demanding procedure, requiring significant laparoscopic  experience. In small infants, space constraints make a laparoscopic approach  unfeasible.&nbsp; In older children, longer  operative time is off-set against decreased morbidity, shorter hospital stay  and a quicker recovery67. Success rates are  comparable to open pyeloplasty. For a description of the technique the reader  is referred to the chapter by Tan in Operative Pediatric Surgery68. A retroperitoneoscopic  approach is employed by others, as illustrated by El-Ghoneimi et al69.<br>
<strong><em>Robotic-assisted  laparoscopic pyeloplasty</em></strong><br>
Robotic surgical systems  offer enhanced manipulation and visualisation and hence a shorter learning  curve than laparoscopic pyeloplasty70. Safety and efficacy  appear comparable to open surgery. Again reduced length of stay and analgesic  requirement has to be balanced against significantly greater operative time71. <br>
<strong>Ureterocalycostomy</strong><br>
In  rare situations, such as for instance, failed open pyeloplasty or an absent  extrarenal pelvis, anastomosis of the ureter to a lower pole calyx may need to  be considered. For the procedure, renal parenchyma overlying the calyx in  question is resected so that the ureter can be sutured to the lower pole  calyx.&nbsp; <br>
<strong>Endopylotomy</strong><br>
Antegrade or retrograde full-thickness incision of  the obstructed segment into perinephric fat by laser, electrocautery,  endoscopic scalpel or balloon can be considered after failed pediatric  pyeloplasty72 followed by a period of stenting. More recently, endopyelotomy has been  investigated as a primary treatment in congenital UPJA73. Careful assessment of the vasculature surrounding the UPJ is essential  if intra-operative hemorrhage is to be avoided. Success rates in the order of  70% have been reported72,73.</p>
  <p><strong>Nephrectomy</strong><br>
For those with a very  poorly functioning hydronephrotic kidney with a normal contralateral kidney,  nephrectomy is recommended. This can be performed open, retroperitoneoscopic or  laparoscopic depending on surgeon preference. <br>
<strong>Complications of pyeloplasty</strong><br>
Most surgeons  advocate antibiotics on induction of anesthesia and for a varying duration  post-operatively. Post-operative infection of the wound or stent does  occasionally occur. Antibiotic/antifungal treatment should be adjusted to  drug-sensitivities obtained from urine, blood or wound swab culture. Early  removal of indwelling &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; is usually needed for resolution.<br>
Pain or fever after  surgery may indicate urine leak or failure of drainage through the anastomosis.  This is confirmed on ultrasound and managed by insertion of a JJ stent and/or  nephrostomy. <br>
Persistent or  recurrent obstruction can result from stricture formation or a flap-valve at  the anastomosis, which may reflect an anastomosis placed too high on the renal  pelvis. Occasionally, a previously undiagnosed co-existing VUJ anomaly only  becomes apparent after pyeloplasty (figure 6). Ureteropyelgraphy may be needed  to accurately diagnose stricture formation at the UPJ or to identify a co-existing  VUJ anomaly. Dilatation and stenting of the stenotic segment can be considered,  although some children will require redo- pyeloplasty, or ureteric  reimplantation after excision of the VUJ anomaly in the future. Re-operation  rates for pyeloplasty are typically 3-5%1.<br>
Loss of renal  function can follow complications. However, the authors have also observed  deterioration of differential function after pyeloplasty with a wide  anastomosis on assessment, primarily in infants with increasing antenatal  hydronephrosis and reduced renal function74,75. <br>
<img src="hydronephrosis_upja_clip_image002_0004.jpg" alt="figure6" width="78" height="189"><br>
<strong><em>Figure 6:</em></strong><em> Post-pyeloplasty  nephro-ureterogram via the trans-anastomotic nephro-stent demonstrating a  dilated ureter ending distally in a &ldquo;beak&rdquo; due to a co-existing VUJA, which had  not been apparent pre-operatively.</em></p>
  <p><strong>Outcome of pyeloplasty and follow up</strong><br>
All considered,  Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty is extremely effective at relieving UPJ obstruction  with reported success rates consistently above 95%. Follow up should include  ultrasound and Mag3. Surgical success is indicated by resolution of symptoms,  stable or reduced hydronephrosis with stable or improved differential renal  function; improvement in drainage on Mag3 is frequently observed. However, it  is important to stress that, especially in grossly hydronephrotic kidneys, slow  or lack of drainage does still not equate obstruction (see renal scintigraphy  section). <br>
Patients may be  discharged from post-operative follow up after one Mag3 and two ultrasound  scans if these show hydronephrosis decreased and differential function stable  or improved. Patients and their parents should be counseled on the symptoms and  signs of urinary tract infection, and that this or the appearance of pain  should prompt a repeat ultrasound scan in the future. In particular for kidneys  with gross hydronephrosis, a longer period of follow up with serial ultrasounds  is usually required to ascertain success1. Mag3 studies may also need to be repeated  to track changes in differential function.<br>
