  <p><strong>Bladder exstrophy is a rare genitourinary malformation that, when simply  defined, refers to the eversion of the bladder to the outside of the body  (Figure 1).</strong><strong>It is a rare genitourinary  malformation for which the management still challenges the field of pediatric  urology. </strong> </p>
  <p><strong>Incidence</strong></p>
  <p>The incidence of bladder exstrophy was originally  estimated between 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 live births [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; However, more recent data from the  International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects monitoring system and the  Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the  United States estimated the incidence to be 2.15 - 3.3 per 100,000 live births.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a> There is a male predominance with the &nbsp;male to female ratio has been reported between  2.3-6:1 [<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p><strong>Embryology</strong></p>
  <p>Mesodermal ingrowth between the ectodermal and  endodermal layers of the bilaminar cloacal membrane results in formation of the  lower abdominal musculature and pelvic bones. After mesenchymal ingrowth  occurs, downward growth of the rectal septum divides the cloaca into a bladder  anteriorly and a rectum posteriorly. The genital tubercles migrate medially and  fuse in the midline cephalad to the dorsal membrane before it perforates. The  cloacal membrane is subject to premature rupture depending on the extent of the  infraumbilical defect. The stage of development when the membrane rupture  occurs determines whether bladder exstrophy, cloacal exstrophy, or epispadias  results [<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p>The most related theory of embryonic development in  exstrophy, held by Marshall and Muecke [<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>],  describes the basic defect as an abnormal lower overdevelopment of the cloacal  membrane, which prevents the medial migration of the mesenchymal tissue.  Therefore proper development of the abdominal wall does not occur. The timing  of the rupture of this cloacal defect determines the severity of the disorder.  Central perforations resulting in classic exstrophy have the highest incidence  (60%) whereas exstrophy variants account for 30% and cloacal exstrophy 10%.</p>
  <p>Other theories are offered concerning the cause of the  exstrophy-epispadias complex. Ambrose and O&rsquo;Brian postulated that an abnormal  development of the genital hillocks with fusion in the midline below rather  than above the cloacal membrane result in the exstrophy defect [7]. Another  hypothesis describes an abnormal caudal insertion of the body stalk with  failure of the interposition of the mesenchymal tissue in the midline [<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>].  As a consequence of this failure, translocation of the cloaca into the depths  of the abdominal cavity does not occur. A cloacal membrane that remains in a  superficial infraumbilical position represents an unstable embryonic state with  a strong tendency to disintegrate [<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>].  No one theory seems to elucidate all aspects of the complex seen clinically and  further study is ongoing to fully describe the developmental process that  ultimately forms the exstrophy-epispadias complex.</p>
  <p><strong>Inheritance</strong></p>
  <p>Evidence exists for a genetic predisposition for  exstrophy and epispadias. The risk of recurrence of bladder exstrophy in a  given family is approximately 1 in 100 [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>],  much greater than in the general population.&nbsp;  There are many reports of twins with exstrophy.&nbsp; At the same time, however, there are also  reports of identical twins with both having exstrophy and another set in which  only one was affected. There are numerous cases of nonidentical twins in which  only one sibling was affected.&nbsp; These  twin sets were found in both male and female pairs [1,4].&nbsp; Concordance analyses of twins with bladder  exstrophy-epispadias complex also suggest a genetic etiology [<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>].  A report of 151 families with exstrophy-epispadias complex found 4 multiplex  families for a rate of 2.7% [<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>].  The likelihood of an exstrophic parent producing a child with exstrophy is  about 1:70 live births or 500 times the risk for the general population [4].<br>
    Many efforts have been made to understand the possible  etiologies of the exstrophy-epispadias complex.&nbsp;  The early developmental hormonal milieu associated with in vitro  fertilization has been postulated to be involved based on studies that showed a  7.5-fold increase in exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy associated with the use of  assisted reproductive technology such as introcystoplasmic sperm injection [<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>].  Another epidemiology study showed an increased rate of exstrophy-epispadias  complex births to women who underwent in vitro fertilization [<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>].<br>
    The CASPR3 gene on chromosome 9 has been implicated by  Boyadjiev and colleagues to be associated with the exstrophy complex [<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>].  Another set of genes on the 9th chromosome has been identified to  associate with bladder exstrophy [<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>].  Genetic studies are attempting to determine where and if specific genetic  factors can be found that are related to the exstrophy-epispadias complex.  Multiple other possible gene loci have been identified but not confirmed [<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>].<script async

  <p><strong>Prenatal Diagnosis</strong></p>
  <p>Despite the magnitude of the defect in the lower  abdominal wall and pelvic organ development, exstrophy of the bladder is still  difficult to diagnose reliably by prenatal ultrasound. This is likely because  of its rare incidence and that it is often mistaken for more common diagnoses  of omphalocele or gastroschisis. Several groups have illustrated ultrasound  findings important in the prenatal diagnosis of exstrophy. In a review of 25  prenatal ultrasounds with subsequent birth of a newborn with classic bladder  exstrophy Gearhart et al [<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>]  described the main criteria for the prenatal diagnosis of exstrophy.&nbsp; This criteria included the (1) absence of  bladder filling, (2) lower abdominal mass which becomes more protuberant as the  pregnancy proceeds, (3) a low-set umbilicus, (4) separation of the pubic rami,  and (5) difficulties determining the sex of the baby. In analyzing this data,  bladder exstrophy should always be suspected on the basis of non-visualization  of the bladder. </p>
  <p>It is felt that 3-D ultrasound and the increasing use of  fetal MRI will improve the ability to diagnosis bladder and cloacal exstrophy [<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a>].  Prenatal diagnosis allows for prenatal counseling and arrangements to be made  for delivery at a specialized exstrophy center.&nbsp;  This allows for a multidisciplinary approach by teams with experience  dealing with the unique nature of the exstrophy-epispadias complex.&nbsp; This includes availability of reconstructive  teams in the immediate newborn period and psychosocial support for the parents  and families.</p>
  <p>The diagnosis of bladder exstrophy is made (or  confirmed) at birth with visualization of the bladder plate characteristically  protruding beneath the umbilical cord with divergent rectus muscles on either  side leading to widely separated pubic bones. </p>
  <p><strong>Skeletal Defects</strong></p>
  <p>The most obvious skeletal defect is the separation of  the pubic bones, which is caused by the outward rotation of the innominate  bones, eversion of the pubic rami, and a 30% shortage of bone in the pubic  ramus [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; The mean external rotation of the posterior  aspect of the pelvis was 12-degrees on each side, retroversion of the  acetabulum, and a mean 18-degrees of external rotation of the anterior pelvis  was determined by 3-D CT reconstructions. Further use of 3-D CT scans showed  that the SI joint angle (before closure) was 10-degrees larger in the exstrophy  pelvis compared to age-matched controls and 10-degrees more toward the coronal  plane than sagittal. The bony pelvis was also 14.7-degrees inferiorly rotated.  The sacrum was 42.6% larger by volume measurements and had 23.5% more surface  area. These deformities of the pelvic bones contribute to the shortened  phallus, waddling gait, and outward rotation of the lower limbs in exstrophy  patients. A study of 299 bladder exstrophy children indicated that spinal  variations occur without clinical significance: spina bifida occulta,  lumbarization or sacralization of vertebrae in 11%, uncomplicated scoliosis in  2.7%, and spinal dysraphism in 4%, including myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele,  scimitar sacrum, and hemivertebrae. Only one patient demonstrated evidence of  neurologic dysfunction [<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p><strong>Pelvic Floor Defects</strong></p>
  <p>Data by Stec et al. utilizing 3-D CT imaging  demonstrated that the puborectal slings in classic bladder exstrophy patients  support two times more body cavity than normal age-matched controls [<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>].  While the levator muscle group in normal controls is evenly distributed  posterior to anterior (52% to 48%) to the rectum, there is an uneven 68% to 32%  posterior to anterior distribution in the exstrophy pelvis. There is also a significant  flattening of the levators. A 31.7-degree decrease in the steepness is seen  between the right and left halves of the levator ani and puborectalis sling.  Consequently the anus is anteriorly placed and sometimes patulous as a part of  the posterior extent of the myofascial defect. These musculoskeletal  malformations explain the increased rate of rectal prolapse, especially in the  female exstrophy population.</p>
  <p>Further  study of the pelvic floor has been done with 3-D MRI and has impacted the  understanding of the exstrophy pelvis for reconstruction. Williams et al.  demonstrated that the levator ani group was less dome shaped and more irregular  in the exstrophy population prior to closure when compared to normal controls.  There was also no relationship seen between the degree of pubic diastasis and  the extent of disproportionate curvature of the levator ani muscle group.  Review of post-closure pelvises by MRI revealed that in those with some degree  of continence the intrasymphyseal distance was noted to be the shortest, the  angle of the levator ani divergence sharpest, and the bladder neck most deeply  positioned in the pelvis [<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; Gargollo reported on MRI before and after  exstrophy closure, noting that the puborectalis angle in those with dry  intervals was decreased compared with that prior to closure [<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>].  New reports of the use of 3D perineal ultrasound to evaluate the pelvic floor  of adult exstrophy females showed that the ultrasound findings correlated well  with MRI findings [<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>].  These reports reinforce the necessity for aggressive dissection and posterior  placement of the posterior urethra and bladder along with good reapproximation  of the pubis at the time of closure.&nbsp;  Osteotomies and pelvic fixation should be utilized if reconstruction is  not done in the immediate newborn period. </p>
  <p><strong>Abdominal Wall Defects</strong></p>
  <p>There is a triangular defect as a result of the  premature rupture of the abnormal cloacal membrane in the abdominal wall, and  it is occupied by the exstrophy bladder and posterior urethra.&nbsp; This defect in the fascia is limited  inferiorly by the intrasymphyseal band that represents the divergent urogenital  diaphragm and connects the bladder neck and posterior urethra to the pubic  rami. Wakim and Barbet investigated the relationship of the rectus muscle and  fascia to the urogenital diaphragm and found no gross or histologic evidence of  the striated sphincter [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>].  They did find evidence of bladder musculature extending laterally to the pubis  where it interdigitates with fibers from the rectus fascia to form the fibrous  urogenital diaphragm. The importance of radical incision of these fibers  lateral to the urethral plate down to the level of the inferior pubic ramus and  levator hiatus for the bladder and posterior urethra&rsquo;s position deep in the  pelvis were demonstrated by Gearhart and colleagues, using data from failed  exstrophy closures where these fibers were intact at the time of reclosure [<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>]. </p>
  <p>At the cephalad, limit of the triangular fascial defect  is the umbilicus.&nbsp; The distance between  the umbilicus and anus is foreshortened in bladder exstrophy because the  umbilicus is well below the horizontal line of the iliac crest. Although an  umbilical hernia is usually present, it is typically insignificant in size and  repaired at the time of initial exstrophy closure. </p>
  <p>Inguinal hernias are common. They are due to a lack of  obliquity of the inguinal canal combined with large internal and external rings  and persistence of the processus vaginalis. Connolly and associates reported an  81.8% incidence of inguinal hernia in males and 10.5% in females [<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>].  It is recommended to explore the inguinal canals at the time of exstrophy  closure and excise the hernia sac with repair of the transversalis fascia and  muscular defect to prevent recurrence or a direct hernia.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Anorectal Defects</strong></p>
  <p>The exstrophy patient&rsquo;s perineum is short and broad and  the anus directly behind the urogenital diaphragm.&nbsp; It is anteriorly displaced and corresponds to  the posterior limit of the triangular fascia defect. The anal sphincter complex  is also anteriorly displaced and should be preserved intact.&nbsp; These anatomic factors contribute to varying  degrees of anal incontinence and rectal prolapse. Rectal prolapse frequently  occurs in untreated exstrophy patients with a widely separated symphysis.&nbsp; Usually this is transient, easily reduced and  disappears after bladder closure or cystectomy/urinary diversion. The  appearance of prolapse of the rectum is also an indication to proceed with  definitive management of the exstrophied bladder. If it occurs at any time  after exstrophy closure, posterior urethra/bladder outlet obstruction should be  suspected and immediate evaluation of the outlet tract by cystoscopy should be  performed [<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p><strong>Male Genital Defects</strong></p>
  <p>The male genital defects are severe and challenging at  the time of reconstruction. The phallus is short due to 50% deficiency in  anterior corporal length [<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>]  with preservation in posterior length of the corporal body when compared to  age-matched controls by MRI. The diameter of the posterior corporal segment was  greater than in normal controls. The diastasis of the symphysis pubis increased  the intrasymphyseal and intracorporeal distances, but the angle between the  corpora cavernosa was unchanged because the corporal bodies were separated in a  parallel fashion. This results in a penis that appears short because of the  diastasis and the marked congenital deficiency of anterior corporal tissue.  Releasing the dorsal chordee, lengthening the urethral groove, and mobilizing  the crura in the midline to somewhat lengthen the penis can result in a  functional and cosmetically pleasing phallus. </p>
  <p>Gearhart and associates used MRI to demonstrate in 13  adult men with bladder exstrophy that the volume, weight, and maximum  cross-sectional area of the prostate appeared normal compared with published  controls [<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>].  However, they found that in none of the patients evaluated did the prostate  extend circumferentially around the urethra, and the urethra was anterior to  the prostate in all patients. The free and total PSA levels in adult bladder  exstrophy men were found to be measureable but below the upper limits of  established age-specific references ranges for normal men [<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; There is a single report of a 56 year-old  epispadias patient having prostate cancer with a PSA of 4.2 at the time of  biopsy [<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>].<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    The vas deferens and ejaculatory ducts are normal in the  exstrophy patient as long as they are not injured iatrogenically during closure  or reconstruction. The mean seminal vesicle length was found to be normal. </p>
  <p>The autonomic nerves that innervate the corpus  cavernosum (cavernous nerves) are displaced laterally in exstrophy patients [<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>]  and these nerves are preserved in almost all exstrophy patients as potency is  preserved after surgery. Retrograde ejaculation is found to occur after bladder  closure and bladder neck reconstruction. </p>
  <p>Testes frequently appear to be retractile but have  adequate length in the spermatic cord to reach the flat, wide scrotum without  need for orchiopexy. The testes have not been studied in a large group of postpubertal  exstrophy patients but are generally believed to be not impaired. D&rsquo;Hauwers et  al. reported the use of percutaneous sperm aspiration and intracytoplasmic  sperm injection, and state in 3 exstrophy patients they had good success with  sperm harvesting [<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>]. </p>
  <p><strong>Female Genital Defects</strong></p>
  <p>In girls, the mons, clitoris, and labia are separated  and the vaginal orifice is displaced anteriorly and stenotic. The clitoris is  bifid and the vagina is shorter than normal controls but of normal  caliber.&nbsp; The cervix is found on the  anterior vaginal wall because the uterus enters the vagina superiorly. The  fallopian tubes and ovaries are usually normal. The bifid clitoris should be  reapproximated with the two ends of the labia minora to form a fourchette at  the time of primary closure. Commonly, vaginal dilation or an episotomy may be  required to allow satisfactory intercourse in the mature female. A study of 56  adult women found that 10 developed uterine prolapse at a mean age of 16 years.  Six of whom had previously had reconstruction that included a posterior iliac  osteotomy at a mean age of 2.1 years [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;Urinary Defects</strong></p>
  <p>The exposed bladder mucosa is susceptible to cystic or  metaplastic changes and, therefore, must be irrigated frequently with saline  and protected from surface trauma and exposure by a protective membrane until  surgical bladder closure can be preformed.&nbsp;  Commonly plastic wrap (i.e., <em>Saran  Wrap</em>) is sufficient.&nbsp; The mucosa at  birth can have a segment of ectopic bowel mucosa, an isolated bowel loop, or  most commonly hamartomatous polyps. </p>
  <p>Shapiro and colleagues characterized the neuromuscular  function of the bladder.&nbsp; They showed  that muscarinic cholinergic receptor density and binding affinity were similar  in exstrophy and control subjects [<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>].  Bladder biopsies from 12 newborns with bladder exstrophy, compared to  age-matched controls, found an increase in the ratio of collagen to smooth  muscle in the exstrophy bladders[<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>].  The type of collagens were analyzed and a normal distribution of type I  collagen was present, but a threefold increase in type III collagen was found.  It was later seen that those patients who demonstrated bladder growth by  measuring capacity after successful closure, who were free of infection had a  markedly decreased ratio of collagen to smooth muscle [<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>].  Primary cultures of exstrophy bladder smooth muscle cells were shown to have  growth characteristics similar to those previously reported in non-exstrophy  cells, showing that they likely retain their potential for growth and function  [<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; Mathews and associates found that the average  number of myelinated small nerve fibers per field was significantly reduced in  the exstrophy bladders compared with controls [<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; Preservation of larger nerve fibers was seen,  which led the study to hypothesize that bladder exstrophy in a newborn  represented an earlier stage of bladder development. Multiple  immunocytochemical and histochemical markers, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide  (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related product  (CGRP), protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  phosphate diaphorase (NADPHd) have been studied, and there was no evidence of  bladder muscle dysinnervation morphologically in any cases of bladder exstrophy  [<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>].  However, cases of bladder exstrophy after failed reconstruction did have muscle  innervation deficiencies that increased subepithelial and intraepithelial  innervations. Microarray analysis of exstrophic bladder smooth muscle compared  to &lsquo;healthy&rsquo; controls showed what appears to be a developmentally immature  finding in the exstrophy bladder smooth muscle [<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>].  Therefore, it is felt that although the bladder in an exstrophy patient may be  immature it has the potential for normal development after a successful initial  closure. </p>
  <p>Bladder plate polyps were found to be two types with  overlapping findings: fibrotic and edematous. Both were associated with  overlying squamous metaplasia in 50% of cases. Varying degrees of von Brunn&rsquo;s  nests, cystitis cystica and cystitis glandularis were noted. Cystitis  glandularis was noted in a higher percentage of secondary closures.&nbsp; Future surveillance of those cystisis  glandularis patients is recommended given their potential risk for adenocarcinoma.  This can be done with urine cytology and cystoscopy as they enter adulthood [<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p>The bladder plate may invaginate or bulge through a  small fascial defect at birth but the true estimate of the bladder plate cannot  be evaluated completely until the newborn is under anesthesia and fully relaxed.&nbsp; A small, fibrosed, inelastic bladder and/or  one that is covered with polyps may make a functional repair challenging and  potentially impossible.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Normal cystometrograms were obtained in 70-90% of those  assessed in a group of continent exstrophy patients with normal reflexive  bladders [<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a>].  An evaluation of 30 exstrophy patients at various phases of modern staged  repair prior to bladder neck reconstruction found 80% to have compliant and  stable bladders after bladder neck reconstruction. Approximately half  maintained normal bladder compliance and fewer maintained normal stability. It  was felt by the authors of that study that 25% of exstrophy patients might  maintain normal detrusor function after reconstruction [<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a>].  The microstructure of the bladder of exstrophy patients at various points in  modern staged repair was found to have different caveoli (important  intracellular structures for cell-cell signaling).&nbsp; These caveoli were felt to be normal in those  with a successful closure and improving bladder capacity but lacking in those  who required an augmentation cystoplasty. They noted that the ultrastructure of  cells also was abnormal in the group that failed initial closure [<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a>]. </p>
  <p>The remainder of the urinary tract is usually normal but  anomalies do occur. Horseshoe kidney, pelvic kidney, hypoplastic kidney,  solitary kidney, and dysplasia with megaureters can all be encountered.&nbsp; The course of the ureter is abnormal in terms  of termination.&nbsp; Because the peritoneal  pouch of Douglas, between the bladder and the rectum, is enlarged and unusually  deep, the ureter is forced down laterally in its course across the true  pelvis.&nbsp; The distal segment approaches  the bladder inferiorly and laterally to the orifice.&nbsp; This results in vesicoureteral reflux in 100%  of exstrophy cases. Ureteral reimplantations are done at the time of bladder  neck repair but sometimes are needed sooner. If there are problems with  infections and excessive outlet resistance, ureteral reimplantation may be  needed prior to bladder neck reconstruction or at any point if severe reflux  and upper tract issues develop.</p>
  <p><strong>Evaluation and Management at Birth</strong></p>
  <p>In the delivery room the umbilical cord should be tied  with 2-0 silk close to the abdominal wall so the umbilical clamp does not  irritate or traumatize the exposed bladder mucosa. The bladder mucosa should be  frequently irrigated with warm saline and always covered with a protective  clear plastic wrap until the time of closure.&nbsp;  The bladder should be irrigated and plastic wrap changed at each diaper  change.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A multidisciplinary approach is important.&nbsp; The team should include, but not be limited  to, a pediatric urologist, pediatric orthopedic surgeon, pediatric  anesthesiologist, neonatologist, pediatric psychiatrist (with expertise and  experience in genital anomalies) and social workers. Studies have proven that  the parents of exstrophy patients experience a significant amount of stress.  The parents stress should not be overlooked during the initial and long-term  care of the patient [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>].  The parents should be reassured that children with classic bladder exstrophy  are generally healthy, robust infants with the prospect of leading a very  normal life. Effective reconstruction to allow urinary storage, drainage, and  control can be expected with acceptable cosmetic appearance. The support of  psychologists, nurses, and parents of other children with exstrophy is  invaluable and available at an Association of Bladder Exstrophy Children (ABC)  certified center.&nbsp; The ABC website (<a href="http://www.bladderexstrophy.com">www.bladderexstrophy.com</a>) also  offers further information for parents and families.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A neonatologist should evaluate the patient from a  general pediatric and cardiopulmonary standpoint with the likelihood of major  surgery in the first 48 hours of life. A cardiac echo is commonly done to rule  out significant cardiopulmonary anomalies that would preclude early  reconstruction. A renal ultrasound should be obtained to evaluate the upper  urinary tracts. A KUB is done to evaluate the pelvis bony anatomy and a spinal  ultrasound to rule out an associated spinal dysraphism. </p>
  <p>It is essential that a pediatric genitourinary surgeon  with experience and interest in the exstrophy-epispadias complex evaluate the  newborn exstrophy patient, as the impact of a major birth defect is  significantly worse by inappropriate initial management [<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In those patients with ambiguous genitalia in addition  to bladder exstrophy the parents should be educated and counseled by a  multidisciplinary disorders of sexual differentiation team but should  understand that the need to change the gender rearing in classic bladder  exstrophy is almost nonexistent in the male infant with current reconstructive  outcomes. </p>
  <p>As many of these cases still go undetected until the  time of delivery, most will require transport to an exstrophy center soon after  birth. During travel, the bladder should be protected by a clear plastic  membrane and kept moist to protect the delicate bladder mucosa.&nbsp; <script async

  <p><strong>Surgical Reconstruction</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The goals of surgical reconstruction in the exstrophy patient are to  correct the urogenital defects providing a reservoir that is adequate for  urinary storage at low pressures with the ability to empty completely without  compromising renal function, to create functional and cosmetically acceptable  external genitalia, and to maximizing patient quality of life. </strong></p>
  <p>Early attempts at bladder exstrophy were unsuccessful  and patients had short life expectancies. Therefore, for many years the  management for exstrophy consisted of removal of the exstrophic bladder and  urinary diversion commonly by ureterosigmoidostomy.&nbsp; Various staged repairs began to show early  success in the 1950s [<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; In the 1970s, the preliminary constructs of  staged repair that are utilized today were initiated [<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>].  This developed into the modern staged repair of exstrophy [<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>]  that is commonly used today. In the late 1980s an anatomical approach to  exstrophy repair began and has been modified into what is now referred to as  the complete primary repair of exstrophy or Mitchell technique [<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>]. <strong>Currently, most patients are  managed either with a complete primary repair of exstrophy (CPRE [65]) or  modern staged reconstruction of exstrophy (MSRE) [</strong><a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a><strong>]. </strong>A great deal  of discussion continues regarding the optimal treatment of exstrophy in the  newborn period.&nbsp; With that in mind,  ureterosigmoidostomy remains a popular and preferred reconstruction in many  parts of the world because it reliably achieves urinary continence and is  relatively safe for those without access to dependable health care facilities  or a specialized exstrophy centers [<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p><strong>Complete Primary Repair of Exstrophy </strong></p>
  <p><strong>The CPRE is the most recent development in surgical management of  exstrophy patients pioneered by Dr. Mitchell [63]. This approach has been  adopted and reproduced by multiple centers of excellence for exstrophy  management. In the CPRE, an anatomic approach to reconstruction includes  bladder closure with bladder neck remodeling and a disassembly technique for  epispadias repair with or without osteotomies in one setting [</strong><a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a><strong>]. It is felt  this allows for bladder cycling and more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; growth and development  because the bladder experiences an outlet resistance. The disassembly technique  for epispadias repair also allows for division of the intersymphyseal ligaments  and appropriate anatomic placement of the bladder neck and posterior urethra  deep into the pelvis in its orthotopic position [</strong><a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> </a><strong>]. When done  within the first 72 hours of life, the pelvis is malleable enough to close  without osteotomies. The patients still necessitate Bryant&rsquo;s traction for  approximately 1 week and then lower extremitiy casting for 3 weeks to prevent  tension on the pelvis closure. The incidence of dehiscence and bladder prolapse  is rare in the modern day [</strong><a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""> </a><strong>]. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>The CPRE is advocated as an approach to allow for maximal development of  the bladder and define those patients whose bladders will grow and develop  earlier than those managed in a staged manner.&nbsp;  Normalizing the anatomy at the initial closure just after birth may have  other benefits such as minimizing the family&rsquo;s psychosocial trauma. Patients  whose bladder does develop will likely undergo fewer procedures than in a  staged fashion. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Continence has been reported after CPRE to be 76%, defined as dry  intervals longer than 2 hours and spontaneous voiding without catheterizations  [</strong><a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""> </a><strong>]. However, a  significant percentage of patients will likely still require a formal bladder  neck procedure to achieve continence [</strong><a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""> </a><strong>]. In another  series, 75% of patients after CPRE were continent with intervals of 4 hours and  dry at night with 31.3% requiring CIC [</strong><a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""> </a><strong>]. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Concerns with the CPRE are related to potential for renal deterioration  related to a high pressure lower urinary system, risk of penile injury or loss  with disassembly at such a young age, and requirement for multiple procedures  despite the name &lsquo;complete repair.&rsquo;&nbsp;  Close follow-up of the upper tracts is important in exstrophy regardless  of repair. Hydronephrosis, pyelonephritis and renal scarring are seen after  CPRE and should be managed aggressively with prophylactic antibiotics since  vesicoureteral reflux is expected post operatively. Long-term follow-up in the  Seattle series shows that mild (45%), moderate (17.8%), and severe (7.1%)  hydronephrosis is seen after CPRE. But half of those with hydronephrosis, and  in all with severe hydronephrosis, it was transient [</strong><a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""> </a><strong>]. Borer and  associates reported an incidence of pyelonephritis of 28% and DMSA renal  scaring of 19% after CPRE [70]. The need for bilateral ureteral reimplantation  after CPRE exclusive of those done at the time of bladder neck repair are seen  to be 25-34% [70,</strong>71<strong>,</strong>72<strong>]. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Approximately 36-68% of patients will be left with a hypospadias after  CPRE that will require further penile surgery [63,69,70,</strong>71<strong>,72,</strong><a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""> </a><strong>].&nbsp; Glans necrosis, penile skin loss and/or  penile tissue loss has been reported after CPRE but is quite rare when  performed at an exstrophy centers of excellence [</strong><a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""> </a><strong>,</strong><a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""> </a><strong>].</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Comparing the number of procedures that a patient may be expected to  undergo is a controversial topic when comparing the CPRE and MSRE. Reports vary  widely about the number and types of procedures and the reports are fraught  with potentials for bias making it difficult to draw true conclusions on this  subject [</strong>75<strong>]. However, it is accepted that  patients managed in a CPRE and MSRE approach will likely require multiple  procedures and the outcomes are better if managed at a center of excellence for  exstrophy. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Modern Staged Reconstruction of  Exstrophy </strong></p>
  <p><strong>The MSRE as now practiced has evolved from the original work by Cendron [</strong>59<strong>] and Jeffs. [</strong>60<strong>] The Hopkins group, led by Dr.  Gearhart, currently has the largest exstrophy population and writes the  majority of the literature regarding the MSRE [</strong><a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a><strong>]. In the MSRE, the goal at  initial reconstruction is to convert the exstrophic bladder to a complete  epispadias. Pelvic osteotomies are performed in conjunction with bladder  closure when indicated. It is felt that this will allow for protection from  renal dysfunction because the patient is still incontinent but can also  stimulate bladder growth since there is now some bladder outlet resistance. The  epispadias repair is performed between 6-12 months of age and testosterone  stimulation is provided preoperatively. The bladder neck repairs for continence  is performed between 4-5 years of age if they have an adequate bladder capacity  and are determined to be ready to participate in a postoperative voiding  program [</strong>76<strong>]. If these criteria are not met, the patient is left incontinent until  the bladder grows and maturity improves or they are diverted with an  augmentation with a catheterizable channel and bladder neck closure when  necessary.&nbsp; </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Continence rates are reported by Gearhart in males to be 70% and females  to be 74% with dry periods greater than 3 hours with spontaneous voiding and  dry at night without CIC [</strong>76<strong>,</strong><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a><strong>]. They have  concluded that a bladder capacity of 100 ml predicts success at the time of  bladder neck reconstruction utilizing the modified Young-Dees-Leadbetter  repair. This increased the chance of continence and time to achieve continence  in their reviews [</strong>76<strong>,</strong>77<strong>]. If this 100 ml capacity is not  achieved it is felt they should undergo an augmentation at the time of  reconstruction for continence. They also found that females were more likely to  achieve continence and at a shorter duration after bladder neck reconstruction  [77]. Their reports also show similarly low complication rates.&nbsp; In males after closure, epispadias, and  bladder neck reconstruction the total complication rate was 41.7% with one  incidence of primary closure failure [</strong>76<strong>]. In females after bladder  closure and bladder neck reconstruction the total complication rate was 19.5% [</strong>77<strong>]. In their modern series if  successful bladder growth occurs 19.4% of males and 17% of females failed  bladder neck reconstruction and have undergone or will require an augmentation  with a catheterizable stoma and bladder neck closure as indicated [</strong>76<strong>,</strong>77<strong>]. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>In the MSRE, if a patient&rsquo;s bladder capacity does not develop to the  level that predicts success with bladder neck reconstruction, the patient is  moved directly to an augmentation for continence. This is reasonable but clouds  comparisons between MSRE and CPRE. The MSRE reports those that complete the  series. Because the CPRE performs a continence procedure at the initial  closure, they are including those patients whose bladders may not have  developed and never been a candidate for a bladder neck reconstruction had they  been managed by MSRE. Also, it is difficult to determine how many, if any, of  those bladders that did not develop to 100 ml capacity by continence age would  have grown had they had a CPRE at initial closure with increased outlet  resistance available to promote development. There also may be a certain subset  of exstrophy bladders that are &lsquo;bad&rsquo; and will not grow regardless of closure technique  but are unable to be identified at birth. These factors make it difficult to  define success and failure when comparing techniques. Further long term  prospective analysis needs to continue in an unbiased and open minded fashion  to promote the interchange of ideas that can hopefully lead to the next  breakthroughs in management of exstrophy that will continue to improve the  quality of life of these patients. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Summary of Agreed Upon Surgical  Reconstruction Tenants</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Management should be done at an  exstrophy center of excellence and with a multidisciplinary team</li>
    <li>Bladder plate should be moist  and covered with saran wrap after birth until closure</li>
    <li>Early successful primary  closure is paramount to achieve continence later</li>
    <li>Osteotomies are necessary if  pelvis is closed at &gt;72 hours of life</li>
    <li>Close follow-up of upper tracts  is important after bladder closure</li>
    <li>Multiple procedures are  required for to achieve continence and reconstruction of anatomy</li>
    <li>Augmentation with or without  catheterizable stoma and bladder neck closure may be required in those who fail  to achieve continence</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Sexual Function in the Exstrophy  patient</strong></p>
  <p>There are reports of adult male exstrophy patients  fathering or initiating a pregnancy that show that fertility is possible in  these patients although it may not be commonplace.&nbsp; Shapiro&rsquo;s large series of 2500 patients only  documented 38 males who had fathered children [4].  Semen analyses studies comparing men who underwent primary repair to  ureterosigmoidostomy diversion found a normal sperm count in only one of eight  in the closure group and in four of eight in the diverted group [<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; These differences were attributed to  retrograde ejaculation and iatrogenic injury during functional closure of the  bladder.&nbsp; Another study found that none  of their reconstructed patients could ejaculate normally nor had they fathered  children. Five patients who had not undergone reconstruction had normal  ejaculation and two had fathered children [<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>].  This leads to the conclusion that the male patient is a high risk of infertility  after reconstruction.&nbsp; The use of  assisted reproduction in any fashion has been shown by Bastuba and coworkers to  be successful in 13 males with exstrophy that led to successful pregnancy with  no incidence of exstrophy in the offspring [<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p>Woodhouse reported that the sexual function and libido  of the exstrophy patient is normal [<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; Multiple reports show that erectile function  is maintained in a vast majority after urethral and phallic reconstruction, and  that ejaculation is often not normal but is usually present.&nbsp; Most reported satisfactory orgasms, and  described intimate relationships as serious and long-term [79,<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p>The female external genitalia are now routinely fully  reconstructed at the time of exstrophy closure.&nbsp;  Previously this reconstruction consisted of a cosmetic reapproximation  of the bifid clitoris and anterior labia to make a fourchette but did not  address the inherent anatomic abnormality of the vaginas location and angle  relative to the abdomen and perineum in exstrophy females [<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; Further reconstruction during adolescent  years, prior to initiation of sexual activity or use of tampons in some female  exstrophy patients was not uncommon [<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; An application of the total urogenital  complex mobilization was applied and resulted in successful correction of the  location and angle of the vagina in female exstrophy patients [81].&nbsp; Successful intercourse has been reported in  all patients in one study and dyspareunia was reported in a minority [82]. A  large series also reported that female exstrophy patients greater than 18 years  of age had normal sexual desires and many were sexually active with normal  orgasms [<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>].  Some patients were self-conscious of and limited their sexual activity because  of the cosmetic appearance of their external genitalia. A monsplasty is an  important part of reconstruction in females and use of hair bearing skin and  fat to cover the midline defect is routine.&nbsp;  A later repair with the use of rhomboid flaps was reported with good  success [<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a>]. </p>
  <p><strong>Obstetric and Gynecologic Implications</strong></p>
  <p>Many women with bladder exstrophy have successfully  delivered normal offspring (45 women with 49 children in one report) [<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a>].  Another study showed 40 women, ages 19 to 36 that were treated for bladder  exstrophy as infants, and out of those 40 women 14 pregnancies were reported in  11 women.&nbsp; Out of those 14 pregnancies  were 9 normal deliveries, 3 spontaneous abortions, and 2 elective abortions.  Uterine prolapse occurred in 7 of the 11 patients during pregnancy [<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; It is seen to be very common for these women  to have cervical and uterine prolapse after pregnancy and delivery [85]. In  these early reports, all women apparently had undergone prior permanent urinary  diversions but recent reports show that successful pregnancies have been  reported in women who have undergone continent urinary diversions [<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> </a>].  Cesarean sections were preformed in women with functional bladder closures to  eliminate stress on the pelvic floor and to avoid traumatic injury to the  urinary sphincter mechanism [85]. </p>
  <p>Pelvic  organ prolapse appears to be a significant problem in female exstrophy  patients.&nbsp; It is commonly seen during and  after pregnancy or delivery, possibly in up to half of patients [82]. It can  occur at young ages and without prior sexual activity or pregnancy [82,83]. The  anterior displacement of the vaginal os and marked posterior displacement of  the dorsorectalis sling and its deficient anterior compartment were theorized  as reasons for significant findings of prolapse [64]. It is felt that more  modern reconstruction of the pelvic floor and anatomical replacement of the  bladder into the pelvis and use of osteotomies may improve this troubling  problem. Previous reports showed that uterine suspension was only modestly  successful in prevention of recurrent prolapse [64]. However, Stein reported  that uterine fixation by <a name="OLE_LINK1">sacrocolpopexy </a>corrected  prolapse in 13 females with greater than 25 years of follow-up [<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""> </a>].  </p>
  <p><strong>Cloacal Exstrophy</strong></p>
  <p>Cloacal exstrophy is the most severe defect that can  occur in the formation of the ventral abdominal wall and represents the most  severe anomaly of the exstrophy spectrum that is compatible with viability.  This entity is extremely rare, occurring in 1 in 200,000-400,000 live births [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>].  The male to female ratio has most recently been reported in a large  contemporary study to be equal between the sexes, 1:1 [14]. Most cases are  sporadic. However, isolated incidences of unbalanced translocations have been  reported to be potentially causative by Thauvin-Robinet et al [<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>].  Although it is likely multifactorial, genetic studies continue to help  determine potential etiologies.</p>
  <p>In the past, children with cloacal exstrophy did not  survive past the newborn period.&nbsp; In  1960, Rickham reported the first patient with cloacal exstrophy to survive  surgical reconstruction [<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; The omphalocele was repaired, the intestinal  strip was separated from the hemibladders, and the blind-ending colon was  pulled through to the perineum.&nbsp; The  hemibladders were then reapproximated.&nbsp;  An ileal conduit was constructed at the age of 18 months and a  cystectomy was performed later. After early reconstruction, the patient was  left with two stomas.&nbsp; With advances in  critical care and current anatomic repairs, most patients now can live well  into adulthood.&nbsp; The focus of care and  research is now on improving the quality of life of these patients [<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p><strong>Anatomic Anomalies</strong></p>
  <p>Cloacal exstrophy includes findings of exstrophy of the  hindgut/bladder complex, complete phallic separation, wide pubic diastasis,  prolapsing terminal ileum, imperforate anus, and an omphalocele. Cloacal  exstrophy is considered part of the OEIS complex when seen coexisting with  omphalocele, imperforate anus, and spinal defects [<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p>The lower urinary tract is typically composed of two  exstrophied hemibladders adjacent to the midline exstrophied intestinal  segment. Each bladder is drained by its ipsilateral ureter and is in close  approximation to the hemiphallus on the ipsilateral side. Variations, however,  are frequent.&nbsp; <br>

  <p><strong>Neurospinal Anomalies</strong></p>
  <p>Neurospinal abnormalities have been noted in 85-100% of  patients with cloacal exstrophy [<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>,<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>]  with a distribution of lumbar (80%), thoracic (10%) and sacral defects (10%). A  single center review of 34 patients found 17 lipomeningoceles, 8  myelomeningoceles, 7 with spina bifida, and 2 with isolated cord tethering  [92]. It is also reported that only 1 in 5 children with spinal dysraphism by  ultrasound has a defect appreciated on physical exam [<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>].  Since there is an almost ubiquitous neurospinal defect it is recommended that all  cloacal exstrophy patients have a spinal evaluation by ultrasound or MRI.&nbsp; It is reported that spinal ultrasound  findings are comparable to MRI for the diagnosis of spinal anomalies in  newborns with cloacal exstrophy. Ultrasound is quicker, easier, and less  expensive to perform and does not require sedation [<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>].  Therefore, all children with cloacal exstrophy should have a spinal ultrasound. </p>
  <p>The functional deficits in the cloacal exstrophy patient  can vary widely from almost normal sensation of the pelvis and lower extremity  to severe impairments rendering the patient wheelchair bound. The presence of a  significant neurologic deficit is associated negatively with the ability to  develop continence [<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p>Schlegel and Gearhart first described the neuroanatomy  of the pelvis in the child born with cloacal exstrophy [<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a>].  The autonomic innervation to the bladder halves and corporal bodies arises from  a pelvic plexus on the anterior surface of the sacrum. The phallus is usually  separated into a right and left half with adjacent scrotum or labia.  Occasionally, the penis is together in the midline, but the structure is  diminutive and the corporal bodies are small. </p>
  <p>The nerves to the hemibladders travel along the midline  on the posteroinferior surface of the pelvis and extend laterally to the  hemibladders. The autonomic innervation of the phallic halves arises from the  sacral pelvic plexus, travels in the midline, perforates the inferior portion  of the pelvis floor, and courses medially to the hemibladder. This more medial  location of the autonomic bladder innervation makes it easy to injure at the  time of initial bladder dissection and reconstruction, which creates a  neuropathic bladder [98].</p>
  <p>McLaughlin and associates postulated that the  embryologic basis for the neurospinal defects in cloacal exstrophy were  secondary to problems with the disruption of the tissue of the dorsal  mesenchyme, not the failure of neural tube closure [95] It has also been  suggested that the defects associated with the formation of cloacal exstrophy  could pull apart the developing spinal cord and vertebrae [<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a>]. </p>
  <p><strong>Skeletal Anomalies</strong></p>
  <p>The pelvic defects in cloacal exstrophy are similar in  nature but more severe than that in bladder exstrophy. Sponseller and  associates described the pelvic anatomy using CT scans in the cloacal exstrophy  population [<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; The interpubic diastasis was found to have a  mean of 0.5 cm in controls and 8 cm in cloacal exstrophy patients, which is  almost twice that of bladder exstrophy patients. The anterior segment length  (distance from the triradiate cartilage to the pubis) was 37% shorter in  cloacal exstrophy patients.&nbsp; Also, the  angle of iliac wing was markedly increased at 45-degrees, showing the extreme  amount of external rotation.&nbsp; Likewise,  the ischiopubic angle was clearly increased in the cloacal exstrophy children.  Overall, patients with cloacal exstrophy have extreme abnormalities of the  pelvis: asymmetry between the sides, sacroiliac joint malformations, and  occasional hip malformations.&nbsp; The long  bone lengths are relatively similar to those with bladder exstrophy.  Microscopically, the bones in children with cloacal exstrophy were similar to  those in normal controls and were seen to develop at a similar rate.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> </a></p>
  <p>Skeletal and limb anomalies were reported in 12-65% of  cases of cloacal exstrophy [<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""> </a>].  Most were clubfoot deformities, but absence of feet, severe tibial or fibular  deformities, and congenital hip dislocations were also commonly seen in this  group of patients. This was confirmed by Greene&rsquo;s report of a high incidence of  foot abnormalities and abduction of the hip [<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p><strong>Gastrointestinal Anomalies</strong></p>
  <p>Omphaloceles are reported in more than 88-100% of  cloacal exstrophy [92,103]. The omphaloceles can vary widely in size and  usually contain small bowel contents, liver, or both. Immediate closure of the  omphalocele defect is recommended to prevent subsequent rupture and  evisceration.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Other  significant gastrointestinal anomalies were reported in 46% of cloacal  exstrophy patients [<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; Such anomalies included malrotation, bowel  duplication, duodenal atresia, duodenal web, and Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum.  Ultimately, short gut syndrome is reported in 25% of cloacal exstrophy patients  [103]. Short gut syndrome can also be encountered in the presence of normal  small bowel length suggesting an absorptive dysfunction. The importance of  preserving as much bowel as possible and utilizing the hindgut remnant in bowel  reconstruction and not using it for later urogenital reconstruction as has been  performed in the past. </p>
  <p><strong>Upper Urinary Tract Anomalies</strong></p>
  <p>Several series have demonstrated the common occurrence  of upper tract anomalies (41-60%).&nbsp; The  most common anomalies encountered were pelvic kidneys and renal agenesis,  hydronephrosis and hydroureter, which occurred in up to one third of patients  [103]. Multicystic dysplastic kidneys and fusion anomalies were reported.  Ectopic ureters were seen to be able to drain into the vas in the male and into  the uterus, vagina, or fallopian tubes in the female. Ureteral duplication,  congenital stricture, and megaureters were also seen. </p>
  <p><strong>Mullerian and Testicular Anomalies</strong></p>
  <p>The most common mullerian anomaly reported was uterine  duplication (95%) [103] with most having partial duplication, predominately a  bicornate uterus. Duplication of the vagina (65%) [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>]  and vaginal agenesis (25-50%) have also been reported. Gearhart and Jeffs  recommended preserving all mullerian duplication anomalies for possible  utilization in reconstruction of the lower urinary tract [<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p>In two series of reviews by Hurwitz and et al [105] as  well as Ricketts and colleagues [<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>],  the testes were undescended and found in the groin or abdomen and commonly  associated with inguinal hernias.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Anomalies</strong><strong> </strong></p>
  <p>Life-threatening anomalies of the cardiovascular and  pulmonary systems are rare.&nbsp; However,  there are case reports of patients with cyanotic heart disease, aortic  duplication, vena caval duplication, bilobed lung and an atretic upper lobe  bronchus.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Prenatal Diagnosis</strong></p>
  <p>Austin and colleagues [<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>]  established major and minor criteria for the prenatal diagnosis of cloacal  exstrophy based on the incidence of prenatal ultrasonography findings in 20  patients. Major criteria were found in &gt;50% of cases and included  nonvisualization of the bladder (91%), a large midline infraumbilical anterior  wall defect or a cystic anterior wall structure (82%), an omphalocele (77%),  and a myelomeningocele (68%). The minor criteria included lower extremity  anomalies (23%), renal anomalies (23%), ascites (41%), widened pubic arches  (18%), narrow thorax in (9%), hydrocephalus (9%), and a single umbilical artery  (9%). It has also been suggested to add the characteristic elephant trunk  appearance that the prolapsing terminal ileum can produce [<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; Regardless of the criteria, the entity is  very rare and still difficult to diagnosis prenatally.&nbsp; When a prenatal diagnosis is made, the  parents should be counseled by an experienced exstrophy genitourinary surgeon  and referred to an exstrophy center of excellence for delivery whenever possible. </p>
  <p><strong>Neonatal Assessment</strong></p>
  <p>The care of these complex patients should occur in an  exstrophy center of excellence where there is experience with these patients&rsquo;  special issues and resources are available. The bowel/bladder plates should be  kept moist and protected with warm saline and a clear plastic wrap, as with  bladder exstrophy. The infant&rsquo;s condition at birth may be critical and attempts  to reconstruct and repair may be futile or morally and/or ethically  unwise.&nbsp; Often the severity of cloacal  exstrophy is enhanced by the nature and severity of the associated  anomalies.&nbsp; Immediate management is  intended to medically stabilize the newborn.&nbsp;  Evaluation should involve a multidisciplinary team, as previously  discussed, for bladder exstrophy.&nbsp; A  thorough discussion and assessment of all the anomalies is important for short  and long term reconstructive planning.&nbsp;  This should include a discussion regarding gender assignment and should  include a disorders of sex differentiation (DSD) team.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideally, this team would include a pediatric  urologist, pediatric surgeon, neonatologist, pediatric endocrinologist, and a  child psychologist/psychiatrist. Decisions should only be made after  appropriate parental counseling and education.&nbsp;  This often will require a chromosomal analysis. </p>
  <p><strong>Gender Assignment</strong></p>
  <p>The need for gender reassignment is only an issue in  those 46XY male cloacal exstrophy patients with inadequate phallic structures  for reconstruction.&nbsp; As surgical  techniques for phallic reconstruction have evolved, a functional and  cosmetically acceptable phallus can now almost always be constructed [<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""> </a>].  This is true even if only unilateral or partial phallic structures are present.  This is obviously a complex procedure that should be managed at a specialized  center for best outcomes, surgically and psychosocially. </p>
  <p>In the past male to female gender reassignment for male  cloacal exstrophy patients was commonplace. Presently, it is the general  consensus among experts that it is important to assign gender that is  consistent with karyotype in this population if at all possible.&nbsp; This is supported by work from Mathews and  associates showing that the histology of testis removed at the time of gender  reassignment were normal [<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p>Long-term evaluation of those patients whom were gender  reassigned at birth has been studied by Reiner and showed that psychosexual  evaluation indicated that all of these patients had a marked shift in  psychosexual development despite having no pubertal hormonal surges [<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; An earlier, smaller evaluation showed that  although these patients had masculine childhood behavior, they had a feminine  gender identity in their report [<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""> </a>].  Another study, which compared cloacal exstrophy to other cloacal anomaly  patients, showed no difference in social or behavioral competence or  psychological problems [<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""> </a>].&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Immediate Surgical Reconstruction</strong></p>
  <p>Cloacal exstrophy patient&rsquo;s reconstructive procedures  should be carefully planned and individualized. Among the important decisions  to make during the initial operative planning is whether to perform a one- or  two-stage closure. A one-stage is preferred if possible to minimize the number  of neonatal procedures necessary. This will also allow the bladder to be  protected and internalized, thereby reducing the risk of external trauma, polyp  formation and potentially improving its chances at normal development.&nbsp; During either a one- or two-stage procedure,  the omphalocele is excised, and the bowel is separated from the hemibladders.  Care must be taken when the bowel is separated from the bladder halves to avoid  damage to the blood supply of the bowel mesentery and the autonomic vesical  innervation, which becomes exposed at the medial aspect of the hemibladder. The  lateral vesicointestinal fissure is closed in continuity, and a short colostomy  is created from the end of the distal colon segment. The hemibladders are then  re-approximated in the midline to create a single exstrophic bladder. If a  one-stage is selected, the entire bladder is closed completely as in a classic  bladder exstrophy patient. Bilateral osteotomies are performed if done after  the first 72 hours of life. With a large omphalocele defect, bladder closure  and osteotomy may be delayed until respiratory and gastrointestinal stability  are achieved [92].</p>
  <p>In patients with spinal dysraphism and myelocystocele, a  neurosurgical evaluation should be completed and closure undertaken as soon as  the infant is medically stable. Long-term follow-up is important since up to  33% of children can have symptomatic spinal cord tethering [95]. </p>
  <p><strong>Management of the Bowel </strong></p>
  <p>Formerly, patients died from fluid and electrolyte loss  with a short bowel and terminal ileostomy. It is now accepted that the best and  first priority when managing the hindgut segment is careful preservation and  incorporation into the gastrointestinal tract to optimize bowel length. It can  be used initially as a fecal colostomy, and it may help absorption and prevent  fluid loss [<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""> </a>]  Also as the hindgut enlarges, if used for a fecal colostomy, it later could be  used as a bladder augmentation or vaginal replacement if nutritional status and  prognosis allow [92,<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""> </a>].  Regardless, the primary emphasis should be on salvaging as much bowel as  possible. </p>
  <p>Placement  of the colostomy or ileostomy at a favorable location is important. It should  be where it can easily be managed with an appliance. If it is determined as the  child ages and grows that an adequate hindgut exists and there are no  neurologic deficits then a pull through procedure could be preformed via the  posterior sagittal approach [<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""> </a>].  It is also emphasized that to maximize quality of life in these patients an  aggressive bowel management program should be adopted. Most of these patients  can be good candidates for a pull-through procedure [<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""> </a>].  Effort should also be made to maintain any appendiceal structures for later  continent stoma construction if necessary.  <br>

  <p><strong>Management of the Phallus and Vagina</strong></p>
  <p>In males with cloacal exstrophy, the penis is usually  represented by two widely separated small phallic structures. Because these  structures are rudimentary and wide apart, reconstruction is challenging.  However, when adequate corporal tissue is present, epispadias repair can be  performed at the same time of initial closure, or later, depending on the  situation. </p>
  <p>If insufficient phallic tissue is present and female sex  rearing is chosen, the medial aspects of the bifid phallus are denuded of  mucosa and brought together in the midline. This is usually done at the time of  bladder closure and osteotomy. If there is a single phallic structure in the  midline (20% of patients) the urethral plate is dissected and the corporal  bodies dropped between them to the perineum for a urethral opening. The corpora  and glands are then recessed for more appropriate female appearance and the  labial folds are created from the scrotum by a posterior Y-V plasty. It should  be reemphasized that if at all possible these patients should be maintained and  reared according to their genetic sex. </p>
  <p>Correction of genital anomalies in girls is usually done  at the time of bladder closure and osteotomy. The medial aspect of the  hemiclitoris is denuded of mucosa and the halves are brought together.  Commonly, duplicate vaginas are far apart and on opposite sides of the pelvis.  In the unusual case of the vaginas being close together, they should be joined  in the midline and used for later reconstruction. The ostia of the vaginas may  be difficult to find at the time of the initial closure, and the surgeon should  be aware that they could enter the posterior walls of the bladder. It is  acceptable to leave the vaginas in situ but further surgery will be need to  bring one of these to the perineum.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In the genotypic male patient raised as a female, the  vagina usually created at the time of puberty. In the past, vaginas have been  created by anatomic &ldquo;scraps&rdquo; such as portion of the duplicated bowel, unneeded  dilated ureters, or a few centimeters of the distal colonic segment. Therefore,  it is debated to wait until puberty and whether or not to construct a vagina  from intestine or from a free full-thickness skin graft. There is little data  of the neovagina in the cloacal exstrophy patient, but as more of these  patients reach puberty, experience with this entity will increase, and  long-term information will be available.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Lower Urinary Tract Reconstruction</strong></p>
  <p>In the one-stage complete primary repair of exstrophy  that is applied to cloacal exstrophy, the hindgut is excised and incorporated  into the colostomy as previously described.&nbsp;  The two hemibladders are re-approximated in the midline and the  omphalocele is repaired and closed giving the appearance of a classic bladder  exstrophy patient.&nbsp; The complete primary  repair may be attempted in cases where the patient is hemodynamically stable,  the omphalocele is small, the pubic diastasis is not wide, and pulmonary  function is adequate to tolerate an increased intra-abdominal pressure. If  these criteria are not met, the patient&rsquo;s bladder plate should again be covered  and maintained with a plastic wrap with frequent irrigation with saline until the  time of definitive management [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>].</p>
  <p>If the patient is deemed an adequate candidate the next steps in the  complete primary repair can be initiated. Complete penile disassembly and  division of the intersymphyseal band are crucial steps to allow for posterior  positioning of the bladder and urethra. Then reconstruction of the bladder,  penis, abdomen, and pelvis approximates the normal anatomy.&nbsp; Osteotomies are almost always necessary to  assist in closure and posterior placement of the lower urinary tract [120].  Postoperative drainage and immobilization are important via ureteral stents, a  suprapubic tube and possibly a urethral catheter along with traction and  casting similar to that in classic bladder exstrophy.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Osteotomies can be performed with this procedure in  cloacal exstrophy patients, as can be done with classic bladder exstrophy  closures. If performing a one-stage closure, the pubic bones and pelvis can be  re-approximated in the same fashion as in the complete primary repair of  classic bladder exstrophy.&nbsp; Regardless,  the goal is to achieve tension-free approximation of the widely separated pubic  bones and of the anterior abdominal wall. Anterior osteotomy also provides  large cancellous surfaces with good healing potential. Furthermore, in cases of  extreme pubic diastasis, combined anterior innominate and posterior osteotomy  may be done within the periosteum through the same skin incision for better  correction. The importance of osteotomy at the time of cloacal exstrophy  closure has been demonstrated by Ben-Chaim and colleagues, who showed that 9 of  22 patients were closed without osteotomies and 89% of them had significant  complications (dehiscence, vesicocutaneous fistula, prolapse) while there were  complications in only 2 of 12 who had an osteotomy at the time of initial  cloacal exstrophy closure [<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>].  Silver and associates have applied a novel approach to osteotomy in cloacal  exstrophy patients with failed prior closures or extreme diastasis [<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> </a>].  In this approach, osteotomy is performed along with external fixator placement  followed by soft tissue and pelvic ring closure two to three weeks later after  the pelvis has been gradually reduced by fixator approximation. </p>
  <p><strong>Management of Urinary Incontinence</strong></p>
  <p>Incontinence of urine is managed by diapering only during  the early years. Intermittent catheterization is likely to be needed for  emptying after any procedure to enhance outlet resistance. This may be due in  part to spinal defects, which can cause a neurologic deficit in bladder  function, or to a small bladder capacity, which may require augmentation. In  both instances, bladder detrussor activity usually is impaired. In cases closed  with complete primary repair, a bladder septum may play a role in poor bladder  function and is hypothesized to be related to residual hindgut remnants that  are incorporated in the closure and an alternate procedure may be required to  separate this septum when it is identified [120]. The role of bladder outlet  repair in cloacal exstrophy is minimal. Husmann and associates clearly showed a  very marked difference in continence results between cloacal exstrophy and  classic bladder exstrophy [97]. This is likely due in large part to co-existing  neurologic abnormalities. Surgery to produce a continent reservoir should be  delayed until the child is old enough to participate in self-care. The choice  between a catheterizable urethra or an abdominal stoma depends on the adequacy  of the urethra and bladder outlet, the intellect and dexterity of the child,  and the child&rsquo;s orthopedic status as regards to the spine, hip joints, braces  and ambulation. </p>
  <p>Occasionally, hindgut is available for bladder  enhancement, but ileum has traditionally been used. In an effort to avoid  further loss of absorptive surface by preserving both hindgut and ileum, Adams  and colleagues have used stomach for a gastrocystoplasty with good success  although long-term cancer concerns exist [<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""> </a>].  Regardless of which bowel segment is chosen, bladder augmentation should be  delayed until bowel function is mature and nutrition and acidosis are no longer  a problem.</p>
  <p>Some patients with a minimal neurological lesion have a  functioning bladder and can void through a reconstructed bladder outlet.  Innovative methods may be needed, however, to construct a continent outlet in  patients without substantial native urethral tissues. These techniques include  use of vagina to form a urethra, with reimplantation of the vagina into the  bladder for continence, or an ileal nipple, as described by Hendren [<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""> </a>].  Urinary continence is possible in most children but usually will require a  bladder augmentation and intermittent catheterization in some form [64].&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Long-Term Psychological and  Psychosexual Issues</strong></p>
  <p>With improved survival and reconstructive surgery,  long-term adjustment issues have become paramount. Reiner has reported on six  children who had undergone gender reassignment, all with developmental  difficulties [<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""> </a>].  None had undergone replacement with exogenous female hormones and most  expressed typical male behavior. Two had spontaneous gender assignment and  assigned themselves back to the male sex. All had extensive family counseling  at birth as well as continued counseling through childhood for the parents and  children. In contrast, Shober reported 46 XY cloacal exstrophy patients whom  all had feminine typical core gender identity on long-term follow-up [<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""> </a>].  The patients will have to be followed into adult life for appropriate  decision-making and information to be obtained. Also, in the same study,  regardless of karyotype, the quality of life of those patients raised female  sex was good. All disliked their colostomy and the need to catheterize but the  quality of life was rated high. </p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>The management of cloacal exstrophy has improved to  provide more quality of life for these children. Complete reconstruction in the  newborn period seems to be the best approach if the infant&rsquo;s condition allows.  Neurological and gastrointestinal management takes precedence over urological  and genital repair and the hindgut should be primarily incorporated to maximize  bowel length and function. Improvements in neurological evaluation have served  to reduce life-threatening complications and the progression of neurological  deficits. Urinary incontinence is now possible in most children but requires  further reconstruction. Current surgical reconstructive techniques have  advanced enough that many more XY patients can be reconstructed and reared  male, which appears to be the optimal choice; however, further long-term  evaluations are needed to assess their satisfaction. Advances in tissue  engineering and stem cell research will likely allow congruent rearing of all  male patients with cloacal exstrophy. Further long-term research is mandatory  to continue progress in the treatment of these interesting children at  specialized centers with experience managing these complex issues with a  multidisciplinary team approach.</p>
