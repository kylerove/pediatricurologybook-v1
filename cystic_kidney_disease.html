  <p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
By definition, cystic kidneys contain cysts in place of part or all of the  normal renal tissue, but there are many types and marked clinical heterogeneity.  For classification, cystic kidneys can be broken down into genetic or  non-genetic causes but new technologies are rapidly reducing the proportion in  the latter group and it is clear that many apparently sporadic cases do have  underlying mutations. Polycystic kidney disease is the classical genetic form  and it is split into autosomal dominant (ADPKD) and recessive (ARPKD)  inheritance. ADPKD mutations are much commoner (1 in 6-800) than ARPKD (1 in  5,000 mutation frequency, equating to 1 in 20,000 disease) but it is the latter  which is more likely to cause problems with antenatal and early presentation with  chronic kidney disease during childhood. The other major inherited forms are the  recently named &lsquo;ciliopathies&rsquo; where defects in development or function of  primary cilia lead to kidney cysts, laterality defects and diverse pathologies.  Examples include Bardet-Biedl syndromes, Nephronopthisis and there is a move to  include PKD itself in this group too. Sporadic cystic kidneys fall into the  multicystic/cystic dysplastic spectrum where the cysts are often part of a  wider developmental defect in the kidneys and urinary tract. These are  sometimes termed congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). </p>
  <p><strong>Antenatal diagnosis </strong><br>
    Cystic kidneys are readily detected by ultrasound,  so they are increasingly being diagnosed on antenatal scan (Winyard and Chitty 2008). There is a catch, however, in that the early  stages of any cyst development or the multiple small cysts of ARPKD are below  the resolution of ultrasound. Hence, there may be non-specific appearances  rather than frank cysts, including one or more of increased size, bright  echotexture and loss of cortico-medullary differentiation. ADPKD can also  present like this in the newborn period but more classically exhibits a few  large cysts which multiply and expand over time. Multicystic dysplastic kidneys  also have moderate to large cysts from presentation but there is little normal  renal tissue between them.</p>
  <p><strong>ADPKD</strong><br>
    ADPKD  accounts for around 5-10% of adult patients on dialysis or with a renal  transplant in the developed world, but it rarely causes problems in childhood (Fick-Brosnahan  et al. 2001). Ninety % of patients have an  affected parent, and diagnosis can virtually be confirmed by finding cysts  therein. Renal cysts develop progressively over many decades, however, so one has  to be careful about negative results if the parents are young. A useful guide  is that around 95% of affected individuals will have cysts by the time they  reach 30 (Liapis  and Winyard 2007). Renal complications include  stones, infections, flank pain and gross haematuria, but there is also a risk  of hypertension, liver and pancreatic cysts, and cerebral aneurysms. </p>
  <p>Mutations  in PKD1 or PKD2 cause over 98% of ADPKD (Harris  and Rossetti 2010). A third locus (PKD3) has been  postulated but never proven. PKD1 mutations have earlier onset of symptoms  compared to PKD2 but both genes exhibit extensive allelic heterogeneity and  variable clinical manifestations, perhaps attributable to genetic background  and environmental differences which modify pathogenesis (Fain  et al. 2005). PKD1 is located on chromosome  16p13.3 and encodes a 460 kDa protein, polycystin 1. PKD2 maps to 4q13-q23 and encodes  polycystin 2, a calcium channel which interacts with its larger counterpart in a  transmembrane polycystin complex in the plasma membrane. Localisation includes  cilia but both polycystins are also found in many other sub-cellular sites  including basal and lateral cell junctions (Wilson  2004) </p>
  <p><strong>ARPKD</strong><br>
    ARPKD is  much less common than ADPKD, but more likely to present before birth or in  childhood so it was often known as &lsquo;childhood PKD&rsquo; before its inheritance and  genetics were defined. This confusing term should not be used since there is  now plenty of the dominant disease diagnosed in childhood because of family  genetic testing. ARPKD typically presents antenatally because of bright,  enlarged kidneys and there is a high chance of perinatal death from immature  lung development &nbsp;if there is severe  oligo- or anhydramnios before 24 weeks gestation (Winyard  and Chitty 2001). Postnatally, affected children  may be diagnosed serendipitously because of enlarged kidneys but they are more  likely to present with symptoms and signs of failing renal function. Of note,  hypertension is common in ARPKD and can require multiple medications to  control. Hepatic fibrosis can also become an issue as the child gets older.  Around 85% of ARPKD patients survive the perinatal period, and historical US  figures suggest 78% at 1 year and 75% survival at 5 years (Guay-Woodford  and Desmond 2003). Parallel studies from the United  Kingdom suggest actuarial renal survival of 86% at 1 year and 67% at 15 years  for those patients that survive the first month (Roy  et al. 1997). <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Mutations  in the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 gene (PKHD1) cause ARPKD; this is located on  chromosome 6p21 and encodes a protein named fibrocystin (or polyductin by  different authors). There are a large number of known mutations spread  throughout the gene, and the majority of patients are compound heterozygotes.  There is a high risk of fetal presentation and neonatal death if the child  carries two truncating mutations (Bergmann  et al. 2005). Fibrocystin localises strongly  to the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells, and there is evidence that  this may also form part of the wider polycystin complex (Wang  et al. 2007). Cysts only derive from the  collecting ducts in ARPKD, but can come from all nephron segments in ADPKD  (although 85-90% still arise from collecting ducts!). <strong></strong><br>

  <p><strong>Simple cysts</strong></p>
  <p>Simple kidney cysts are usually solitary and  have no functional consequence. Their aetiology is unknown, but they are not  inherited and cysts become commoner as people get older; indeed it is estimated  that almost a third of those above 70 have at least one simple cyst. Children  rarely have simple cysts, but there are case reports of isolated cysts with  normal renal function, blameless ultrasound of the rest of the kidney and  urinary tract and no evidence of hypertension (Murthi et al. 2001). Most cases  are asymptomatic and only picked up by chance when abdominal/renal ultrasound  is done for other purposes. Pain can occur secondary to the cysts, however, and  cysts occasionally become infected or start to bleed. Standard adult therapy  for these complications includes aspiration and injection of sclerosant but  these must be undertaken with caution in children since the cysts may be the  first manifestation of polycystic kidney disease, where it is well-recognised  that these techniques do not prevent further cyst formation.</p>
  <p><strong>Cystic dysplasia and multicystic dysplastic kidneys </strong><br>
Dysplasia  implies abnormal development and/or tissue components, which immediately  highlights a difference with PKD because cysts in the latter are generated from  normal parts of the nephron whereas there is reduced through zero &lsquo;normal  tissues&rsquo; within dysplastic organs. Instead, dysplastic kidneys contain poorly branched/differentiated  nephrons and collecting ducts with increased stroma and smooth muscle (Winyard &amp; Chitty 2008). Occasionally,  there are also metaplastic areas of cartilage. Dysplastic kidneys are common with  unilateral maldevelopment occurring in 1 in 1000, and bilateral in 1 in 5000,  although it is only a subset of these that contain significant cysts. Cystic dysplastic  kidneys represent one end of this spectrum, often containing areas with  relatively normal nephrons adjacent to dysplastic regions with small to  moderate cysts. Multicystic dysplastic kidneys are the other end, comprising  just a collection of cysts with no functioning renal tissue. They are often  connected to atretic ureters, and many of the molecular features of dysplasia  can be replicated by obstruction in experimental animals but it is likely that  genetic influences and environmental factors also play a part in pathogenesis (Yang et al. 2001). </p>
  <p>Antenatal  ultrasound often picks up dysplastic kidneys at the routine 20-week scan,  usually as large bright kidneys, with or without cystic spaces. They may also  be small, but there is ascertainment bias for larger ones, as they are easier  to visualise and smaller kidneys may be masked by (or attributed to) technical  difficulties. Multicystic dysplastic kidneys have characteristic appearances of  multiple thin-walled non-connecting cysts in an enlarged kidney with an  irregular non-reniform outline. They are sometimes difficult to distinguish  from severe hydronephrosis with calyceal dilatation but the lack of a  normally-situated renal pelvis and absent arterial flow using colour Doppler  ultrasound can be diagnostic. Many dysplastic kidneys involute as the fetus /  child grows (Rickwood et al. 1992;Rottenberg et al. 1997) and they can  disappear before or after birth. The critical factor for longterm renal  function is whether the contralateral kidney undergoes compensatory hypertrophy  (Rudnik-Schoneborn et al. 1998).</p>
  <p>Most  dysplastic kidneys appear sporadic, although a family history of renal or  urinary tract malformations was historically elicited in 10-15% of cases (McPherson et al. 1987). The commonest genetic cause is  mutations of the TCF2 gene which encodes the protein hepatocyte nuclear factor  (HNF) 1&beta;. This was initially reported with cystic kidneys and maturity-onset  diabetes of the young, but the malformation spectrum now includes cystic  dysplastic, hypoplastic, polycystic and glomerulocystic kidneys, as well as  solitary kidneys where the abnormal one may have involuted (Edghill et al. 2006). In recent analyses of selected  populations, TCF2 mutations were reported in 29% of a series of 62  patients with antenatally diagnosed bright kidneys (Decramer et al. 2007) and 23% at our specialist referral hospital (Adalat et al. 2009). Mutations have also been reported with dysplastic  kidneys in many other genes over the last few years including PAX-2 (renal-coloboma  syndrome), Uroplakins, BMP4, SIX-1 and 2, EYA1 (Branchio-oto-renal syndrome),  and SALL1 (Townes-Brocks syndrome) (Jenkins et al. 2005;Weber et al.  2006;Weber et al. 2008). There are also several inherited glomerulocystic  diseases which combine variable elements of dysplasia (from mild hypoplasia  through frank cystic dysplasia) with clear cysts arising from Bowman&rsquo;s capsule.  These can sometimes be mistaken for ADPKD, but many of the syndromic cases such  as Oro-facial digital syndrome have classical abnormalities in other organs  which point towards the true diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
    The  likelihood of developing chronic renal failure in patients with bilateral  dysplasia is difficult to predict before birth, but there is a clear correlation  between early childhood renal function and long-term outcome (Ismaili et al. 2001;Van Dyck et al. 1998). It is worth  noting, however, that the normal postnatal renal maturation can be delayed by  several years in dysplastic kidneys (Gonzalez et al. 2007). Prognosis of  dysplasia associated with lower urinary tract malformations cannot be estimated  accurately until the abnormalities are corrected (Drozdz et al. 1998;Godley et al. 2001). &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Anecdotal  reports suggested that dysplastic kidneys risk developing hypertension and  tumours, but recent systematic reviews have suggested that these complications  are very uncommon (Narchi 2005a;Narchi 2005b), and there is  no evidence-based reason for elective nephrectomy unless there are  complications such as frequent urinary tract infections. </p>
  <p><strong>Ciliopathy-based diseases</strong><br>
There are  an increasing number of conditions that are classified as ciliopathies because  the mutated genes involved encode proteins that localise to the primary cilium (Hildebrandt  et al. 2009). These are membrane-enclosed  finger-like organelles that project out from the cell, usually on the apical  surface or facing into a lumen, duct or airway (Ong  and Wheatley 2003). Again, the terminology is  confusing because most textbooks include discussion of diseases such as  Kartagener&rsquo;s syndrome and say that this results from primary ciliary dyskinesia,  but the defect is not in primary cilia at all! The primary defect there is in  motile cilia which have the classical &lsquo;9+2&rsquo; arrangement of structural  microtubules necessary for coordinated beating to clear respiratory secretions.  True primary cilia have a &lsquo;9+0&rsquo; arrangement lacking the central microtubules  and these have multiple roles in mechanosensation, photoreception and chemosensation.  It is the first of these which links the ciliopathies to cystic kidney diseases:  physiological fluid flow across the apical surface of renal cells bends the cilia  and induces calcium influx, and this is perturbed when the ciliopathy genes are  mutated. Downstream effects include changes in cell differentiation and  polarity, with perturbation of iconic pathways such as Hedgehog and Wnt  signalling (Winyard  and Jenkins 2011).</p>
  <p>The PKD  genes are expressed in the primary cilium and clearly have massive cyst  formation and destruction of normal tissues, but many of the other conditions  on the ciliopathy list have their major abnormalities in other organ systems  such as the heart, eye or nervous system; hence, they will not be discussed further  here but there are several excellent recent reviews (Waters and Beales 2011). For  reference, the current list includes Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, Nephronophthisis, Alstrom  Syndrome, Orofaciodigital Syndrome, Senior-Loken Syndrome and Usher Syndrome.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Treatment of cystic kidney diseases&nbsp; </strong><br>
    There are not currently any specific treatments that target the  development of cysts. Hence, the mainstay of treatment for all of these  conditions is supportive care to regulate blood pressure and manage  complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Blockade of the renin-angiotensin  pathway using ACE inhibitors and receptor blockers is routine therapy in most  CKD, particularly when there is significant proteinuria, and has recently been  shown to slow renal deterioration in children (Wuhl et al. 2009). Surgery is only really useful to  correct urological abnormalities, and cyst deroofing or aspiration is rarely  used since cysts rapidly re-accumulate. Nephrectomy is occasionally warranted  before transplant if the kidneys are massive, but most organs tend to fibrose  and become smaller as end-stage is reached. There are rare case reports of  emergency removal of cystic organs that splint the diaphragm and/or interfere  with feeding in the neonatal period (Bean et al. 1995;Komura et al. 2008) </p>
  <p>Experimental animal work on PKD has uncovered a raft of new  potential treatments for some conditions in the past 5 years. These include  modulation of the vasopressin system using tolavaptan/similar agents or  increased water intake; blockade of mTOR pathways using rapamycin-like drugs, and  somatostatin. The updated list of trials can be viewed at <a href="http://www.pkdcure.org/Research/ClinicalTrials/ActiveRecruiting.aspx">http://www.pkdcure.org/Research/ClinicalTrials/ActiveRecruiting.aspx</a> It is hoped that one or more of these may be successful and that these treatments  can then be trialled for other paediatric cystic diseases in future. </p>
  <p><strong>Figure</strong><br>
Haematoxylin  and Eosin-stained sections from paediatric cystic kidneys. Views of the cortex  are shown in the left column and medulla in the right. A and B) Autosomal  Dominant PKD with a few cysts in both cortex and medulla arising from all  nephron segments. This was from an early stage, hence the well-preserved architecture  of the normal surrounding glomeruli, tubules and collecting ducts. C and D)  Autosomal Recessive PKD with numerous elongated cysts running through the  cortex and medulla; note that all of the glomeruli appear to have a normal,  undilated Bowmans space since cysts only arise from collecting ducts in this  condition. E and F) Glomerulocystic kidney diseases with marked dysplasia; note  the significant disruption of renal differentiation and the glomerular tufts  visible in virtually every cyst. G and H) Cystic dysplastic kidneys display  virtually no normal renal structures, instead there are large areas of poorly  differentiated stroma, a few irregular dilated tubules and numerous cysts.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
