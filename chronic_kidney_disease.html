  <p>INTRODUCTION<br>
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the term used for irreversible  kidney damage that can lead to a progressive decrease in kidney function. The  term CKD  has replaced the earlier terms of chronic renal failure (CRF) or chronic renal  insufficiency (CRI) as it more clearly defines renal dysfunction as a  continuum, rather than a discrete change. </p>
  <p>DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS&nbsp;<br>
    The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality  Initiative (KDOQI) definition and classification has become  internationally accepted. <br>
    The  K/DOQI workgroup defined CKD as either </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The presence of markers of kidney  damage for at least three months, as defined by structural or functional  abnormalities of the kidney with or without a decreased glomerular filtration  rate (GFR) that is manifested by either pathological abnormalities or other  markers of kidney damage, including abnormalities in the blood, urine, or in  imaging tests. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>or</p>
  <ol>
    <li>GFR below 60 mls/min/1.73m2  for at least three months, with or without kidney damage.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The K/DOQI has also developed a classification system for the severity  of CKD based on GFR and independent of primary renal diagnosis (Table 1). GFR  is equal to the sum of the filtration rates in all of the functioning nephrons  and therefore, can give an estimate of renal function. Interpretation requires  a clear understanding that GFR varies according to age, gender, and body size.  The normal GFR is much lower in infancy and reaches adult values after one year  of age. Despite this, a calculated GFR based upon serum creatinine can be  compared to normative age-appropriate values to detect renal impairment even in  toddlers and infants with CKD. As actual determination of the glomerular  filtration rate (GFR) is cumbersome an alternative is estimating GFR by using  serum creatinine, height, and in adolescents, the gender of the patient (Table  2). However in patients with an unusual dietary intake (eg, vegetarian diet or  creatinine supplements) or in those with decreased muscle mass (eg, amputation,  malnutrition, or muscle wasting), the estimated GFR might not be accurate and  the formal GFR calculation may be more advisable.</p>
  <p>EPIDEMIOLOGY<br>
There are  limited data on the epidemiology of CKD in children. The most comprehensive  report is from the prospective, population-based registry, ItalKid project,  which included all Italian paediatric cases of CKD defined as a creatinine  clearance (CrCl) less than 75mls/min/1.73m2 between 1990 and 2000. The  mean annual incidence and prevalence of CKD were 12.1 and 74.7 cases per  million children and adolescents below 20 years of age, respectively. <br>
Larger  registry based data are available primarily on children with end stage renal  disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy. Based on these the estimated  incidences for ESRD in children from United   States, New Zealand,  and Austria are 14.8, 13.6,  and 12.4 per million children whereas it is lower at 4 per million in Japan. The  difference in incidence of ESRD around the world can be attributed to various  reasons including presence of screening programmes and easy availability of  renal replacement therapies. <br>
The  commonest primary diagnosis for CKD in childhood is congenital anomalies of the  kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including renal dysplasia, renal hypoplasia  as well as obstructed uropathies including those secondary to posterior  urethral valves. A male preponderance is often observed primarily because of  the higher incidence of CAKUT among boys. <br>
In the  North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS)  database, which includes patients below 21 years of age with a CrCl less than 70  mls/min/1.73m2, the age distribution at presentation were as  follows:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Below 2 years of age: 20%</li>
    <li>2 - 6 years of age: 16%</li>
    <li>6 - 13 years of age: 32%</li>
    <li>13 -18 years of age: 28%</li>
    <li>18 - 21 years of age: 4%</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AETIOLOGY<br>
&nbsp;Congenital renal anomalies and glomerular  disease accounted for 57% and 17% respectively of over 7000 children with CKD  in the largest database provided by NAPRTCS.&nbsp;  Congenital renal anomalies such as renal dysplasia with or without  vesico-ureteric reflux / with or without posterior urethral valves; were commoner  among younger children. Glomerular disease was common in older children,  accounting for approximately 45% of cases in patients older than 12 years of  age. The commonest glomerular disorder was focal and segmental  glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which occurred in 9% of all CKD cases.  African-American children were three times more likely to develop FSGS than  Caucasian patients (18% versus 6%), and FSGS was the cause of CKD in one-third  of African-American adolescent patients. It is important to note that in 18% of  all cases of CKD, the underlying primary diagnosis was not identified (15%) or  was unknown (3%). <br>
A similar  distribution of aetiologies was also reported by the Italian registry (ItalKid  project) with the leading cause being renal hypoplasia/dysplasia, which  occurred with and without urinary tract anomalies in 54% and 14% of patients,  respectively. </p>
  <p>NATURAL  HISTORY AND PROGRESSION OF CKD<br>
Children  with established CKD can show a continued progression of renal disease leading  to end stage renal disease (ESRD). This has been well demonstrated by the  NAPRTCS database which showed 86% of children registered progressed to ESRD  (although this may be skewed as most of those registered in NAPRTCS were having  advanced CKD).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The  persistent deterioration of renal function may be a result of repeated and  chronic insults to the renal parenchyma leading to permanent damage and/or to  the adaptive hyperfiltration response of the kidney, which compensates for the  loss of nephrons from the initial injury. The adaptive hyperfiltration process  increases the filtration rate in the remaining nephrons by increasing  glomerular pressure and flow. Although this can initially maintain normal or  near-normal glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine in patients with  mild impairment; with time the enhanced trans-glomerular ultra filtration and  glomerular pressure leads to glomerular damage and interstitial inflammation  and fibrosis. <br>
Deterioration  of renal function among children with CKD is particularly common during infancy  and puberty as during these two periods of rapid growth the sudden increase in  body mass results in a rise in the filtration demands on the remaining  nephrons. Therefore, children with CKD should be closely monitored during these  two periods. <br>
The rate  of progression to ESRD is primarily influenced by the underlying diagnosis and  the baseline CrCl at presentation. In addition to this a number of other  factors also influence disease progression such as hypertension, proteinuria, obesity,  dyslipidaemia, anaemia, intra-renal precipitation of calcium and phosphate and  metabolic acidosis. Genetic, familial, or ethnic predisposition may also influence  the rate of renal decline as seen by the faster rate of progression among  African-Americans. <br>
Many of  these factors are modifiable with early interventions. The initial report from the  CKiD study (an ongoing prospective study following up more than 580 children  with CKD) linked proteinuria, a modifiable factor, with decreased GFR.  Similarly the ESCAPE trial showed definite benefit of strict blood pressure  control in slowing the progress of CKD.</p>
  <p>CLINICAL  PRESENTATION<br>
In view  of the wide heterogeneity of the underlying cause of kidney injury the  presentation of CKD also varies widely. Antenatal ultrasound screening can now  identify many foetuses with CAKUT. Those detected in early stages of CKD are  likely to be asymptomatic and are often detected on routine examination or work  up for some other medical problem. In contrast, children in advanced stages of  renal failure are more likely to be symptomatic.<br>
Glomerular  diseases are more likely to present with nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome  (with oedema, hypertension, discoloured urine and or decreased urine output  (oliguria)). In contrast to adults, where oliguria is a common finding among  patients with CKD, polyuria (increased urine output) may be the presenting  finding for many congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (eg, dysplastic  kidneys), inherited disorders (eg- nephronophthisis), and tubulointerstitial  disorders as they are associated with reduced concentrating ability. It is  important to be aware of this presentation as impairment in renal concentration  and the resulting polyuria generally precedes a significant reduction in GFR  and if detected early can provide a window period wherein one can initiate  measures to slow the rate of progression of CKD.&nbsp; <br>
Incidental  detection of CKD is also not uncommon. This can happen during routine blood or  urine checks for unrelated or related conditions, such as poor growth, which is  a common manifestation of CKD in children when the underlying kidney disorder  is often detected late. In addition, with the greater availability of  ultrasound scans incidental detection of renal anomalies is also increasing. <br>
Symptoms  and/or signs of severe renal impairment usually begin to appear by Stage III CKD.  These symptoms (referred to as symptoms of uraemia) include anorexia, vomiting,  weakness and easy fatiguability. Other findings attributable to the uraemic  state include pericarditis, deficits in neurocognitive function and renal osteodystrophy.  Apart from these, specific signs and symptoms of the underlying aetiology (such  as lupus nephritis or vasculitis) may be present and should always be searched.</p>
  <p>COMPLICATIONS  OF CKD&nbsp;<br>
As CKD  progress to Stage 3 onwards, a number of complications are manifested due to  impairment of the multiple functions performed by the kidneys. These include  disorders of fluid and electrolytes, renal osteodystrophy, anaemia,  hypertension, dyslipidaemia, endocrine abnormalities, growth impairment, and  decreased clearance of toxic substances.<br>
In the  largest single centre study (366 children) of children with CKD, the majority of  whom were in Stage I CKD (57%), the overall prevalence of complications like  hypertension, anaemia, renal osteodystrophy, growth failure and significant  electrolyte disturbances were 70%, 37%, 17% 12% and 9% respectively.<br>
<em>Fluid and electrolyte imbalance</em><br>
Fluid and  electrolyte disturbances usually present when the GFR falls below 10 to  15mls/min/1.73m2. As the GFR becomes severely impaired (Late Stage  IV and V CKD), decreased urine output leads to water retention which may result  in volume overload as well as hypertension and hyponatremia. <br>
Of the  electrolyte complications, hyperkalaemia is the most dangerous and usually occurs  at the latter Stage V CKD. Although&nbsp;  hyperkalaemia occurs due to inadequate potassium excretion from reduced  GFR, it is also due to decreased delivery of sodium to distal tubules secondary  to reduced GFR which results in reduced exchange rate of potassium and therefore,  inadequate potassium excretion. Other contributory factors for hyperkalaemia  include increased tissue breakdown due to hypercatabolic state, metabolic  acidosis, type IV renal tubular acidosis in some patients with obstructive  uropathy, hypoaldosteronism (in some cases due to the administration of an  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker).<br>
<em>Metabolic acidosis</em><br>
Metabolic  acidosis is another common complication usually manifesting when the GFR  decreases to below 40 to 50mls/min/1.73m2. This is usually due to  fewer functioning nephrons to maintain the degree of ammonia excretion required  for acid base equilibrium. The net effect is retention of hydrogen ions  resulting in metabolic acidosis. The anion gap is usually increased in this  setting, but may be normal due to the concomitant retention of anions such as phosphate,  sulphate, urate, and hippurate. The presence of acidosis has a negative impact  on growth, as the body utilises bone to buffer the excess hydrogen ions and it  has been demonstrated that treatment of bone disorders associated with CKD is  better if the acidosis is corrected. In addition, recent research has also  shown a correlation between correction of acidosis and slowing of the  progression of CKD.<br>

  <p><em>Bone disease</em><br>
The bone  disease of CKD, referred to as renal osteodystrophy or more recently described  as CKD-Mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) can have subtle biochemical  manifestation from Stage II CKD disease. The pathogenesis of CKD-MBD is complex  and its understanding is still evolving. It is believed that decreased renal  clearance of phosphorus with resultant increase of serum parathyroid hormone  (PTH) in response to phosphate retention is a key step. Decreased production of  calcitriol&nbsp;(also referred to as 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D) secondary to  renal dysfunction is also thought to be an important contributory factor. In  addition, recent evidence also indicates an increased prevalence of generalised  vitamin D deficiency in children with CKD and this also might contribute to  CKD-MBD. Subtle signs of bone disease begin to appear in patients with Stage III  disease. Patients with more advanced renal osteodystrophy have bone pain,  difficulty in walking, and/or skeletal deformities <br>
<em>Anaemia</em><br>
Anaemia  is the other major complication and is due to reduced erythropoietin which is  primarily produced in the kidneys. It usually develops when eGFR falls below  60mls/min/1.73m2. Anaemia of CKD is normally normocytic,  normochromic and a microcytic picture suggests concomitant iron deficiency or  aluminum excess, while macrocytic picture suggests vitamin B12 or folate  deficiency. Anaemia in children with CKD has been associated with fatigue,  weakness, decreased attentiveness, increased somnolence and poor exercise  tolerance.<br>
<em>Hypertension </em><br>
Hypertension  is among the commonest complication in children with CKD, ranging from 54 to 70%  of patients. It is usually due to volume expansion although it can also be secondary  to excess renin from damaged kidneys or iatrogenic such as use of  corticosteroids or ciclosporin or tacrolimus for treatment of any underlying  renal disease.<br>
Unlike many  of the complications of CKD, hypertension can present in the earlier stages of  CKD, although the prevalence does increase with progressive decline in GFR.  This was shown in the Canadian case series, which demonstrated that the  prevalence of hypertension increased from 63% in Stage I CKD to 80% among those  with Stage IV and V CKD. Detection rate for hypertension does increase with 24  hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as confirmed by preliminary reports  from CKiD where 18%&nbsp; had confirmed hypertension  (both elevated ambulatory and office blood pressures) and an additional 34% had  masked hypertension (normal office but elevated ambulatory BP).<br>
Left  ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is also a common finding and can be of concentric  LVH type secondary to the presence of hypertension or eccentric LVH secondary  to associated volume overload and anaemia. In its preliminary report, the CKiD  study found LVH detected by echocardiography in 17% of cases (with 11%  eccentric LVH and 6% concentric LVH). LVH was more common in children with  confirmed and masked hypertension compared to those with normal BP measurements  (34, 20 and 8%, respectively). </p>
  <p><em>Dyslipidaemia</em> <br>
Abnormal  lipid metabolism is common in patients with CKD and adds to the risk for  cardiovascular disease (CVD) along with hypertension. Young adults aged 25 to  34 years with CKD have at least a 100-fold higher risk for CVD related  mortality and/or morbidity compared to the general population. This has led to  the American Heart Association identifying CKD as one of eight diseases  associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease. <br>
<em>Endocrine dysfunction&nbsp;</em><br>
Thyroid  hormones: CKD states are often associated with &quot;sick euthyroid  syndrome&quot; with low total and free T4 and T3, a normal thyroid stimulating  hormone (TSH) level, and normal or decreased thyroid hormone-binding globulin  levels or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).<br>
Gonadal  hormones: Abnormalities in gonadal hormones are seen in two-thirds of  adolescents with ESRD and can result in delayed puberty. The average pubertal  delay in children with CKD is 2.5 years. Whereas males have reduced levels of  serum free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, adrenal androgens, and increased  level of serum luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),  post-pubertal females with CKD have reduced serum oestrogen, elevated LH and  FSH, and loss of the LH pulsatile pattern. <br>
Growth  impairment:&nbsp;The aetiology of growth failure, a common complication of  childhood CKD, is multifactorial and includes metabolic acidosis, decreased  caloric intake, renal osteodystrophy, and alterations in the function of the  growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) axes. In particular, poor  linear growth is primarily due to increased levels of insulin growth factor binding  proteins, which promotes a growth hormone resistant state resulting in short  stature. <br>
<em>Uraemia</em><br>
As the  kidney failure enters Stage V CKD, a constellation of symptoms and signs referred  to as uraemia is usually manifested. This includes anorexia, nausea, vomiting,  growth retardation, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system  abnormalities ranging from loss of concentration and lethargy to seizures,  coma, and death. Patients who are uraemic also have an increased tendency to  bleed secondary to abnormal platelet adhesion and aggregation properties. They  can also have pericardial disease (pericarditis and pericardial effusion) which  by itself is an indication to institute dialysis in children with CKD. <br>
Neurodevelopment:&nbsp;Uraemia  is associated with alterations of cognitive development in children. The  neurologic findings can range from seizures and severe intellectual disability and  developmental delay to subtle deficits resulting in poor school performance.  The neurodevelopment outcome has shown steady improvement with the avoidance of  aluminium as a phosphate binder, and optimisation of dialysis, nutrition and anaemia  management. Recent studies have shown an overall optimistic outcome among  children started on long term dialysis as well as after renal transplantation. </p>
  <p>Sleep and fatigue:&nbsp;Daytime sleepiness and  fatigue are commonly seen in children with CKD and increases with decreasing  renal function. Sleep disorders (including restless leg syndrome / paroxysmal  leg movements, sleep-disordered breathing, excessive daytime sleepiness, and  insomnia) are also common in children with Stage I to IV CKD as well as in  those on dialysis. </p>
  <p>EVALUATION<br>
The  evaluation of a child with CKD begins with a clinical evaluation, including  history and physical examination. Imaging and laboratory evaluations are useful  adjuncts in not only establishing an underlying cause but also in determining  the severity of renal impairment and identifying any associated complications. <br>
<em>Clinical evaluation</em><br>
The  history should include documentation of the age at onset of symptoms, duration  of symptoms, and the presence of symptoms due to uraemia (weakness, fatigue,  anorexia, or vomiting), any underlying systemic diseases (fever, rash, or  arthralgia / arthritis), or specific renal disorders (eg, glomerulonephritis)  that may present with nephrotic and/or nephritic syndrome. One should also try  to elicit any relevant history such as neonatal, past medical, drug  (nephro-toxicity as well as idiosyncratic reactions) and family history.&nbsp; Particular emphasis on growth failure,  polyuria, polydipsia, enuresis, antenatal detection of any renal anomalies,  spinal abnormalities or recurrent urinary tract infection should be sought.<br>
<em>Physical examination</em><br>
The  physical examination of any child suspected of having CKD should include:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Serial measurements of       growth parameters (height, weight, and head circumference for patients under       three years of age).</li>
    <li>Blood pressure measurement       which should be compared to normative blood pressure centiles based upon       data on gender, age, and height.</li>
    <li>Pallor</li>
    <li>Signs of vasculitis</li>
    <li>Evidence of renal       osteodystrophy: the site and type of deformity of the extremities depends       upon the age of the child and the weight-bearing patterns in the limbs. Therefore,       deformities of the forearms and posterior bowing of the distal tibia are       found more commonly in the infant, whereas genu varum is a characteristic       finding in the toddler. In the older child, valgus deformities of the legs       or a windswept deformity (valgus deformity of one leg and varus deformity       of the other) may be apparent. </li>
    <li>Assessment for the presence       and severity of peripheral oedema.</li>
    <li>Assessment for any sign of       hypervolemia by noting the presence of oedema, rales, hepatic enlargement       and/or tenderness and cardiac gallop.</li>
    <li>Cardiac auscultation to       detect a pericardial rub due to pericarditis or diminished heart sounds       secondary to a pericardial effusion.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Imaging&nbsp;</em><br>
    Ultrasonography  (US)  is the most widely used modality and has the advantage of being non-invasive.  It can be used to assess renal structure for any underlying structural  abnormalities like CAKUT (including obstructive pathology), including cystic  kidney diseases. It is equally useful for measuring the length of the kidneys  which can be compared with normative age-appropriate values. Kidneys that are  smaller than normal indicate a decrease in renal mass due to congenital  maldevelopment (such as renal hypoplasia), poor growth, or loss of nephrons due  to an underlying disorder or injury. In addition, serial follow up of renal  growth can also be accomplished through US. In children with a solitary kidney,  renal length is generally in the upper range of length for normal paired  kidneys and often greater than the 95th centile due to compensatory  renal hypertrophy when the child has normal renal function. It is better to  correlate the kidney size with height in children with CKD as correlating with  age can lead to over-reporting of small kidneys among children with poor  growth. <br>
    Nuclear  scans have specific uses such as demonstrating scars (DMSA scan) or  demonstrating any obstruction in drainage of the urine (DTPA scan). In addition,  they can also give a good estimate of the overall as well as individual renal  functions.<br>
    Other  imaging studies are used less often with their use restricted for cases where  US fails to give proper resolution or visualisation (computed tomography and  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) or definite answers like the presence of  vesicoureteric reflux (such as from a micturating cystourethogram).<br>
    Ionic and  non-ionic contrast agents used for radiographic procedures and imaging studies  may be nephrotoxic and can cause acute renal dysfunction. Gadolinium-based  contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MR angiography have  been associated with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy and sometimes fatal  nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in both children and adults with Stages III, IV  and V CKD.&nbsp; Therefore, contrast agents  should be used with caution in patients with CKD.</p>
  <p><em>Laboratory testing</em><br>
Depending  on the type of kidney disease, blood and urine studies are often used to  support the diagnosis of CKD. Laboratory testing is useful for identifying as  well as monitoring various complications of CKD. In addition, serum creatinine  can give a basic estimate of the degree of renal dysfunction and the estimated  GFR a more reliable estimation of renal function.<br>
In  children, estimated GFR (eGFR) is usually calculated by the Schwartz formula  which was developed in 1970. It was based upon serum creatinine determined by  the Jaffe method, height, and an aged based constant k that varied with age  (and in adolescents the gender of the patient)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;GFR  = k x height (cm) / Serum creatinine [mg/dl (Jaffe method)]<br>
The  constant k is directly proportional to the muscle component of body, and varies  with age. The value for k is 0.33 in premature infants through the first year  of life, 0.45 for term infants through the first year of life, 0.55 in children  and adolescent girls, and 0.7 in adolescent boys.<br>
In  contrast to the older Jaffe method, currently creatinine is usually estimated  by the enzymatic method which results in a lower value of creatinine leading to  overestimating of GFR calculated by the Schwartz formula. A bedside formula  based upon serum creatinine measured by the enzymatic method derived from data  collected from 349 children enrolled in CKiD study has been recently suggested  to have a better correlation with the enzymatic method of creatinine  estimation.<br>
GFR =  0.413 x height (cm) / Serum creatinine (enzymatic method)<br>
As stated  earlier, eGFR can be used to classify the severity of CKD (K/DOQI  classification) as well as follow up the progression of renal dysfunction. <br>
Urinalysis  is a useful screening test for abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract,  and as an aid in identifying the underlying cause of CKD. The urinary dipstick  makes it possible to detect proteinuria, pH, concentrating ability, glycosuria,  haematuria, and pyuria which can serve as an initial guide for the possible  underlying aetiology of CKD. Significant proteinuria along with haematuria is  an indicator of underlying glomerular disease. Proteinuria can also be present  in tubular dysfunction and has been shown to be an important biomarker of CKD  progression. The severity of renal disease is generally associated with the  amount and duration of proteinuria. Therefore, persistent high-grade  proteinuria (2+ proteinuria or greater) usually warrants a prompt evaluation  for other signs of renal dysfunction. The presence of persistent proteinuria by  dipstick evaluation should be quantified by determination of early morning urine  protein or albumin to creatinine ratio. </p>
  <p><em>Additional laboratory tests:</em><br>
Electrolytes  estimation is routinely required to detect abnormalities such as hyperkalemia  and metabolic acidosis (with low serum bicarbonate). Serum calcium, phosphate,  25-hydroxyvitamin D, and parathyroid hormone level are performed to detect any  abnormalities in bone mineral metabolism. <br>
Full  blood count (FBC) is performed to detect anaemia which is a common complication  of CKD. As per K/DOQI guidelines it is defined by haemoglobin (haematocrit)  below the 5th centile of normal when adjusted for age and sex. An  initial reticulocyte count will not only rule out any underlying haemolysis  (atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome) but will also aid in follow up of the  results of any intervention. The red blood cell indices can identify an  underlying iron deficiency (microcytic anemia) or vitamin B12 or folic acid  deficiency (megaloblastic anemia). Iron deficiency should be quantified by  determination of iron status (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, percentage  transferrin saturation). In refractory anaemia, any source of blood loss should  be investigated including testing the stool for occult blood.<br>
Fasting  lipid profile is indicated to detect presence of dyslipidaemia which is not  uncommon among children with CKD. <br>
Kidney  biopsy is rarely helpful in establishing the underlying aetiology of CKD and has  increased risks.&nbsp; It is unlikely to help  in guiding therapeutic choices. However, the biopsy result may provide  information about disease severity, including whether any abnormalities may be  reversible and the degree of renal scarring. <br>

</p>
  <p>FOLLOW-UP  EVALUATION<br>
    CKD is generally  progressive, and therefore, children with CKD require ongoing monitoring of  their renal function, and screening for complications associated with CKD.<br>
    Recommendations  for frequency of clinical, lab and nutritional monitoring of children with CKD  are published in KDOQI Clinical Practice Guideline for Children with Chronic  Kidney Disease. More frequent assessments are recommended in younger children,  and children with severe impairment regardless of age (such as Stage IV and V  CKD). <br>
    The  follow up of children with CKD should ideally be performed in a  multidisciplinary setting (paediatric nephrologist, renal dietician, renal  nurse and pharmacist). Inputs from other specialties are also often required.  During follow up growth, blood pressure, nutritional status should be monitored  along with laboratory parameters (serum creatinine, electrolytes, calcium and  phosphate, haemoglobin, fasting lipid profile, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and  parathyroid hormone level).</p>
  <p>MANAGEMENT<br>
Basic  principles:<br>
The  overall management includes some basic principles:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Treat any reversible condition</li>
    <li>Prevent or slow the progression  of kidney disease targeting hypertension and proteinuria</li>
    <li>Anticipate and prevent the  complications of CKD</li>
    <li>Treat the complications as and  when they are detected</li>
    <li>Identify and adequately prepare  the child and family in whom renal replacement therapy will be required</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The  sequence of implementation of the above principles will obviously be influenced  by the stages of CKD.<br>
    In the  early stages of CKD, the focus should be on identification of any reversible  insult and preventing or slowing the progression of kidney disease. Ideally  this period should also be used to educate the child and family about CKD,  highlighting awareness of risk factors that can aggravate kidney failure (such  as avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, recurrent infections, dehydration) and of  measures that may slow the progression of kidney failure (such as blood  pressure control).<br>
    CKD-associated  complications begin to appear as CKD progresses into Stage 3 where the focus  changes to anticipation, early identification and management of the various  complications. Patients who will require renal replacement therapy (RRT) should  be identified well in advance of the time that RRT is required so that adequate  preparation and education can be provided to both the patient and family. The  gold standard is to prepare for where possible pre-emptive living related renal  transplantation.<br>
    REVERSIBLE  KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION&nbsp;<br>
    The most  common conditions with potentially recoverable kidney function are primarily  due to decreased kidney perfusion or the administration of nephrotoxic agents. <br>
    Kidney  hypoperfusion is usually due to hypotension secondary to shock or volume  depletion from diarrhoea and vomiting. Perfusion to kidneys can also be  hampered by drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).  Children with CKD often have concomitant tubulopathy with disorders in water  and salt retention. They are unable to mount an appropriate response and are  more prone to hypovolaemia which can further aggravate the renal function. If  significant hypovolaemia is accompanied by a reduction of GFR, a judicious  trial of fluid repletion may result in the return of kidney function to the  previous baseline. </p>
  <p>SLOWING  CKD PROGRESSION&nbsp;<br>
In  patients with CKD, progressive long-term kidney damage is in part due to  adaptive hyperfiltration with increased intra-glomerular perfusion and  pressure. The progression of CKD is greatest during the two periods of rapid  growth: infancy and puberty. Although reversal of the process of CKD is not  possible a few interventions have been identified to help slow the progression  of CKD.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blood pressure control: the  recently concluded ESCAPE trial has clearly emphasised the importance of strict  control of blood pressure in delaying CKD progression even in the paediatric  age group. In particular, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been suggested as  antihypertensive therapies to reduce proteinuria and control blood pressure in  these patients. It is suggested that children with hypertension and proteinuria  be treated with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB because of the added benefits of  their anti-proteinuric effect.</li>
    <li>Other interventions:&nbsp;adult  studies have shown the benefit of lipid lowering therapy and correction of anaemia  on CKD progression. Although not proven in children they are often implemented  among paediatric CKD patients. In contrast, restriction of protein, while shown  to be effective among adults with CKD, are not recommended in the paediatric  age group. In a two year prospective, stratified, and randomised multicentre  study of 191 children with CKD, the institution of a low-protein diet (0.8 to  1.1 g/kg) failed to have an impact on the decline in creatinine clearance. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>MANAGEMENT  OF SPECIFIC COMPLICATIONS</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fluid &amp; electrolyte:&nbsp;as  GFR becomes severely decreased (Stages IV and V CKD), water and sodium  retention may result in volume overload. A combination of dietary sodium  restriction and diuretic therapy may correct the increased water balance and  prevent water retention from recurring. Diuretic therapy includes either loop  diuretics such as <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/81902&source=see_link" target="_blank">furosemide</a>&nbsp;given at a dose of 0.5 - 2 mg/kg/day or  thiazide diuretics such as <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/88425&source=see_link" target="_blank">hydrochlorothiazide</a>&nbsp;at 1 - 3 mg/kg/day. Typically,  thiazide diuretics are used in early stages of CKD and a loop diuretic in the more  advanced stages when the thiazides are less effective. Both classes of  diuretics become less effective with decreasing GFR.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some children with obstructive uropathy and/or  dysplastic kidneys have poor urinary concentrating capacity and exhibit urinary  sodium wasting, resulting in a propensity for hypovolaemia and hyponatraemia.  These children may continue to have substantial urine output despite water  losses and require ongoing fluid and sodium replacement. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Potassium  abnormalities: management strategies for hyperkalaemia includes low potassium  diet, loop diuretic (such as <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/81902&source=see_link" target="_blank">furosemide</a>) for increasing potassium excretion, correcting  metabolic acidosis with oral <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/161746&source=see_link" target="_blank">sodium bicarbonate</a>&nbsp;and intake of potassium chelating  agents like <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/162505&source=see_link" target="_blank">sodium polystyrene sulfonate</a> to reduce potassium  excretion.&nbsp;If hyperkalaemia is resistant to this conservative medical  management renal  replacement therapy may become necessary. Hypokalemia is uncommon in children  with CKD apart from iatrogenic cases due to excessive diuretic therapy or  rarely with associated Fanconi syndrome or renal tubular acidosis.</li>
    <li>Metabolic acidosis:&nbsp;overt  acidosis usually presents when the estimated GFR is less than 30mls/min/1.73m2.  Current guidelines by the K/DOQI are to maintain the serum bicarbonate level at  or above 22 mmol/l. It is usually started at 1 - 2mmol/kg/day in two to three  divided doses and thereafter titrated as per response. </li>
    <li>Bone metabolism and bone disease:  changes in mineral metabolism and bone structure are an almost universal  finding with progressive CKD due to abnormalities in the metabolism of calcium,  phosphate, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). If these abnormalities are  not addressed, these changes result in bone disease, referred to as renal  osteodystrophy. Renal osteodystrophy can be prevented by ongoing monitoring of  bone metabolism (measurements of serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate and  parathyroid hormone levels) and appropriate therapeutic interventions including  vitamin D&nbsp;replacement therapy. Significant morbidity may be associated  with renal osteodystrophy, including growth failure, avascular necrosis, and  skeletal fractures and deformities.</li>
    <li>Hypertension: KDOQI recommend the  target blood pressure in children with CKD should be below the 90th centile  based upon the age, gender, and height of the patient or less than 120/80 mmHg,  whichever is lower.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Management of hypertension among CKD population  includes adoption of both non-pharmacologic as well as pharmacologic therapy.  Non pharmacologic intervention includes weight reduction, exercise, and dietary  salt&nbsp;reduction (noting that the recommended daily sodium intake is 1.2  g/day for four to eight year olds and 1.5 g/day for older children). ACE  inhibitors or ARBs are often the preferred agent as they have a dual action on  reducing proteinuria which has been linked to CKD progression. In addition they  have anti-fibrotic activity which may also contribute to the slowing of CKD  progression. <br>
    Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be used  cautiously if the GFR is less than 60mls/min/1.73m2. Since the  decline in GFR induced by an ACE inhibitor typically occurs within the first  few days after the onset of therapy, the serum creatinine and potassium  concentrations should be rechecked within a week after the institution of  therapy to ensure that the therapy has not adversely affected the GFR resulting  in elevation of serum creatinine and/or hyperkalemia. In view of the  teratogenic potential of these drugs, post pubertal females should be  counselled regarding pregnancy. <br>
    In addition to ACE inhibition and ARB, diuretics  are also often used in situations of fluid overload. Although a thiazide can be  used in early CKD it becomes less effective in advanced CKD when loop diuretics  prove to be more effective.&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anaemia: anaemia due to reduced  kidney erythropoietin production generally develops when the GFR falls below 30mls/min/1.73m2.  At the onset of dialysis, the presence of anaemia in children is very common  and has been associated with excessive morbidity and an increased mortality  risk. Children in the early stages of CKD should have their haemoglobin tested  at least annually with the frequency of monitoring increasing as the disease  progresses into more advanced stages. A diagnosis of anaemia is made when the  observed haemoglobin result is below the 5th centile of normal  adjusted for age and sex. Once anaemia is detected in a child with CKD, a  thorough investigation is required to identify any underlying contributing  factor. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Initial investigation should at least include:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Red       blood cell indices</li>
    <li>Reticulocyte       count</li>
    <li>Iron       parameters (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin       saturations [TSAT] and serum ferritin)</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Occult  blood in stool</li>
  </ul>
  If any underlying contributing factors are  identified it should be treated. Iron deficiency is often the most common  underlying contributing factor. Iron therapy (elemental iron 3 - 6 mg/kg per  day) should be initiated if iron deficiency is detected. Iron supplementation  is targeted to maintain a TSAT above 20% and serum ferritin above 100 ng/dl  among children with CKD. In addition to iron supplementation, children with CKD  often require addition of erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) on account of  the diminished erythropoietin secretion from the damaged kidneys. Commonly used  ESA are recombinant human eythropoeitin (rHuEPO) or the longer acting <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/52811&source=see_link" target="_blank">darbepoetin alfa</a>. Once iron status is normalised, it  should be monitored at least every three months or monthly following the  initiation of and/or increase in ESA dosing. Increasing the haemoglobin into an  acceptable range in patients with anaemia may ameliorate anaemia-induced  symptoms (such as fatigue and exercise intolerance), result in cardiovascular  improvement, and possibly decreased mortality. The target haemoglobin for  children with CKD is unclear. Limited data suggest that children with CKD  having haemoglobin less than 9.9 g/dl are at increased risk for mortality, left  ventricular hypertrophy, and/or decreased exercise capacity. In addition,  quality of life and neurocognitive function improved in patients treated with  rHuEPO who experienced a significant increase in haemoglobin compared to  baseline haemoglobin, which was below 9g/dl. K/DOQI has based its  recommendation on expert opinion and has recommended target haemoglobin levels between  11 and 12 g/dl. Recent publications of major studies in adults like CHOIR &amp;  TREAT have questioned the practice of targeting high haemoglobin which has been  found to increase risk of cardiovascular adverse effects, and there is a  trend towards accepting lower haemoglobin targets of 10g/dl as adequate. <br>
  The initial rHuEPO dose in older children not  receiving dialysis is 80 to 120 Units/kg/ week. Children younger than five  years of age or children receiving dialysis frequently require higher doses  (300Units/kg/week). The response to rHuEPO is monitored by haemoglobin measurement  every one to two weeks following the initiation of treatment or following a  dose change until stable target haemoglobin and a stable rHuEPO dose has been  achieved by which time, it should then be monitored every four weeks. <br>
  Failure to mount a good haemoglobin response to ESA  is usually iron deficiency. But if the iron level is adequate other factors  like persistent infection or inflammation, severe hyperparathyroidism, chronic  blood loss, malnutrition, folate or <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/48549&source=see_link" target="_blank">vitamin B12</a>&nbsp;deficiency need to be ruled out. In  addition, one should exclude presence of haemogloinopathies.
<ol>
    <li>Dyslipidaemia:  K/DOQI, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Academy of  Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that all adolescents with CKD should be evaluated  for dyslipidaemia which should include total cholesterol, low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides  at presentation, and annually thereafter or two to three months following a  change in treatment or subsequent to the presentation of another condition  known to cause dyslipidaemia. Although intervention for dyslipidaemia is of  proven benefit among adults with CKD, no such evidence exists for paediatric  CKD patients. In absence of any such proven intervention, any recommendation is  based only on expert opinion. </li>
    <li>Nutrition: malnutrition is often  seen in children with CKD. A number of factors can be attributed. These include  poor appetite, decreased intestinal absorption of nutrients due to altered  transit time, and metabolic acidosis. Attention to nutrition is critical as it  affects both the physical growth and neurocognitive development of children.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As per the K/DOQI paediatric guidelines for  nutrition the nutritional status of children with CKD should be evaluated on a  periodic basis. The frequency should be greater in infancy where early dietary  intervention has been shown to definitely improve growth outcome.<br>
    Nutritional therapy based upon growth parameters  should be developed for each child with CKD and ideally be coordinated by a  dietician with expertise in paediatric and renal nutrition. Nutritional  management should address the energy, protein, vitamin, mineral and electrolyte  needs of the individual patient. <br>
    The initial prescribed energy (calories) for  children with CKD is based upon the estimated energy requirement (EER) for  chronological age. Further supplementation should be considered when the  initial intake fails to meet the child's energy requirements and he/she is not  achieving expected rates of weight gain and/or growth. Although supplementation  by the oral route is preferred, one may have to resort to tube feedings with a  nasogastric tube, transpyloric tube, or gastrostomy to ensure adequate energy  intake. Protein intake should be between 100 to 140% of the Dietary Reference  Intake (DRI) based upon age and gender for children with Stage III CKD and  between 100 and 120% for those with Stages IV and V CKD. Protein restriction is  not recommended in children as it has not been shown to influence the decrease  in kidney function in children with CKD. Children  with CKD should receive 100% of the DRIs for the vitamins, <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/170427&source=see_link" target="_blank">thiamine</a>&nbsp;(B1), <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/154776&source=see_link" target="_blank">riboflavin</a>&nbsp;(B2), pyridoxine (B6), <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/48549&source=see_link" target="_blank">vitamin B12</a>, A, C, E, K, and <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/80192&source=see_link" target="_blank">folic acid</a>, and the minerals, copper and zinc. It has  to be remembered that children with advanced Stage V CKD might be at an  increased risk of developing hypervitaminosis A due to loss of renal clearance  of <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/182361&source=see_link" target="_blank">vitamin A</a>&nbsp;metabolites. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Growth:&nbsp;growth failure is a  common complication of CKD. Like most of the complications of CKD, it is more  prevalent among children with Stage III, IV and V CKD. While the institution of <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/87760&source=see_link" target="_blank">recombinant human growth hormone</a>&nbsp;(rHuGH) therapy  can have a profound effect on the height velocity of children with CKD who are  growing poorly, early recognition and management of malnutrition, renal  osteodystrophy, acid-base abnormalities and electrolyte disturbances should  take place prior to considering the institution of rHuGH.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The  criteria for initiating rHuGH in children with CKD include all&nbsp;of the  following:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Height SDS that is more       negative than -1.88 and/or a height velocity SDS that is more negative       than -2 persists beyond 3 months despite treatment of nutritional       deficiencies and metabolic abnormalities.</li>
    <li>Growth potential that is       documented by open epiphyses.</li>
    <li>There are no       contraindications for rHuGH.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;rHuGH is  continued until the child reaches the 50th centile for mid-parental  height, achieves a final adult height with closed epiphyses, or receives a renal  transplant<br>
    The initial dose of rHuGH in children with CKD is  currently 0.05mg/kg per day (corresponds to 4IU/day/ m2 body surface  area or 1IU/kg/week); rHuGH is given daily via subcutaneous injections. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Neurodevelopment: uraemia is  associated with alterations in cognition and may impact on children&rsquo;s neurodevelopment.  Neurologic findings can range from seizures and severe intellectual disability  (developmental delay) to subtle deficits resulting in poor school performance.  Neurodevelopment impairment can be minimised by optimising nutrition, dialysis,  and anaemia management. Recent publications have shown much better  neurodevelopment outcome when compared to older studies probably reflecting the  more aggressive nutrition and growth management. Proper nutrition ensuring adequate growth and development is most important in  infancy and early childhood when the brain growth is most rapid. This  necessitates frequent monitoring of head circumference and age-appropriate  developmental evaluations and aggressive nutrition support. The cognitive  disturbance in an older child may present with abnormal performance on tasks of  verbal abstract ability, visual perceptual reasoning, memory, and visual motor  skills. A more formal neurodevelopment assessment is needed in older children,  especially if they have poor school performance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If neurodevelopment impairment is identified  interventions should include steps such as review of the general CKD management  including correction of anaemia, checking the adequacy of the dialysis if the  child is on dialysis and ensuring educational support at home and school. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uraemic bleeding: severe chronic  uraemia does cause platelet dysfunction, particularly abnormalities in platelet  adhesion and aggregation. In asymptomatic patients, no specific therapy is  required. In symptomatic children or if a surgical intervention is planned, <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/54358&source=see_link" target="_blank">desmopressin</a>&nbsp;(dDAVP), an analogue of <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=ped_drug/180524&source=see_link" target="_blank">antidiuretic hormone</a>&nbsp;is known to be an effective  prophylactic agent. It is administered intravenously or subcutaneously at a  dose of 0.3mcg/kg with an onset of effect within one hour of administration and  the effect lasts for six to eight hours. Other interventions include  cryoprecipitate (1 - 2 units/10 kg); the effect lasts for 24 to 36 hours, but  there is an increased risk of transmitted infectious diseases. </li>
    <li>The other major problem with  severe uraemia is uraemic pericarditis, which is seen only in the later stages  of CKD and is an indication to institute dialysis. Most patients with uraemic  pericarditis respond rapidly to dialysis with resolution of chest pain as well  as a decrease in the size of the pericardial effusion. </li>
    <li>Renal replacement therapy: as the  CKD progresses or for those children who present in advanced stages of CKD,  preparation should be made for initiation of renal replacement therapy. Ideally  once the estimated GFR declines to less than 30 mls/min/1.73m2 (Stage  IV CKD), both the child and the family should be counselled about various forms  of renal replacement therapy (with the gold standard modality of pre-emptive  kidney transplantation where possible prior to the need for peritoneal dialysis  or haemodialysis). Usually renal replacement therapy is initiated when the GFR drops  to15mls/min/1.73m2 (Stage V CKD), however it may be initiated at  higher GFR if any of the following concerns are present: </li>
    <li>Poor  total calorie intake resulting in failure to thrive</li>
    <li>Clinical symptoms attributable to  uraemia</li>
    <li>Delay in psychomotor development  and/or educational issues from progressive CKD</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Pre-emptive living-related renal transplantation is  often the preferred modality in children as it avoids the problems associated  with dialysis. When parents can donate they are a half haplotype match. In  these situations, the paediatric nephrologist can prepare the patient and their  family for transplantation.<br>
    When pre-emptive transplantation is not an option,  the choice between the two forms of dialysis is generally dictated by  technical, social, concordance issues, and family preference. Peritoneal  dialysis is much more common in infants and younger children in large part due  to problems of vascular access; haemodialysis becomes more common in older  adolescents who have failing peritoneum. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed  by parents at home and can be performed overnight with a cycling machine. The  use of a cycler potentially allows the least disruption of home life, school,  and work attendance, when compared to ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, which  often requires a peritoneal dialysis exchange procedure to be conducted during  the daytime, or haemodialysis, which usually requires three weekly visits to a  haemodialysis centre for at least three to four hours (not counting travel  time). In addition, access to a nearby haemodialysis centre may not be readily  available to patients and their families or the centre personnel may not be  trained to care for children, especially prepubertal children and infants. &nbsp;However, home haemodialysis programmes are  increasing in paediatric practice.</p>
  <p>QUALITY  OF LIFE&nbsp;<br>
CKD -as  is true for any chronic condition, impacts on the quality of life for both the  child and family. A survey of 402 families of 2 to 16 year old children with  mild to moderate CKD (median GFR 42.5mls/min/1.73m2) of median  duration of seven years found an overall low health related quality of life in  children with CKD. They scored lower compared to their healthy peers in all of  the four domains tested: physical, school, emotional, and social.<br>
In  particular, psychological and social stresses are found in children with CKD  and their families. The prospect of a lifetime with renal replacement therapy  (dialysis and/or transplant) and the potential for catastrophic complications  and/or death makes it difficult to achieve normal childhood and adolescent  developmental goals.<br>
Even for  those children who progress to adulthood it is usually an uphill task. Studies  have shown that compared to age-matched population normative data, these  patients are twice as likely to be unemployed (19 versus 11%), and those who  were employed are often at a lower occupational level.<br>
The  negative impact of chronic disease on the emotional status of the patient's  siblings is also well recognised. The siblings frequently feel  &quot;neglected&quot; because the parents must provide substantial physical and  psychological support to the sick child. Furthermore, the well child may  simultaneously feel jealous of the attention provided to the sick child, as  well as guilty about being well while the sibling is severely ill.<br>
Optimal  comprehensive management of these issues involves a multidisciplinary approach  that proactively addresses these concerns. <br>
