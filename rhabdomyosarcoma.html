  <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhabdomyosarcoma  (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in infants and children, with approximately  350 new cases in the United States each year. &nbsp;It is the third most common solid tumor in  children after neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor, making up 10-15% of all solid  pediatric tumors.<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Dasgupta, 2012 #19">1</a> &nbsp;By definition, RMS is a sarcoma with skeletal  muscle differentiation but which can occur in sites where skeletal muscle is  not found, suggesting that it is a tumor of primitive mesenchymal skeletal  muscle differentiation.<a href="#_ENREF_2" title="Crist, 1995 #35">2</a>&nbsp; RMS incidence follows a bimodal age pattern.&nbsp; The first window of increased incidence,  which accounts for more than 50% of cases, occurs in the first decade.&nbsp; This period peaks at a median of 2 years of  age, and consists mainly of embryonal (E-RMS) or botryoid RMS (B-RMS).&nbsp; The second peak occurs during adolescence and  more commonly consists of alveolar RMS (A-RMS).<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Dasgupta, 2012 #19">1</a>&nbsp; In addition to varying in their age at  presentation, the histopathologic variants of RMS (embryonal, botryoid, and  alveolar) are also associated with different patterns of primary presentation  and subsequent outcomes. E-RMS tends to occur in the head/neck and genitourinary  (GU) system and the majority of patients survive beyond 5 years.&nbsp; A-RMS is often seen in the extremities and tends  to metastasize early with a worse survival than E-RMS.<a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Meza, 2006 #18">3</a> <br>
Since its discovery in 1854, study  of the clinical and pathologic features of RMS have progressively led to the  development of uniform diagnostic criteria and staging systems.<a href="#_ENREF_4" title="Pappo, 1997 #21">4</a>&nbsp; The prognostic outlook for RMS has improved significantly  with time, from an estimated survival of 25% in 1970 to over 70% now.<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Dasgupta, 2012 #19">1</a>&nbsp; This success is due to effective multimodal, risk-adapted  therapy, and better supportive care.&nbsp;  Emerging information on tumor biology has afforded new insights into the  pathogenesis of this tumor and has allowed advances in risk-based management.</p>
  <p><strong>Genitourinary  RMS</strong><br>
Fifteen  to 20 percent of all RMS cases arise from the GU system.<a href="#_ENREF_5" title="Perez, 2011 #8">5</a> &nbsp;The  most common GU sites are the prostate, bladder, and paratestis&shy;ticular.&nbsp; &nbsp;Vaginal,  cervical and uterine RMS are relatively unusual sites. &nbsp;As with RMS in general, survival rates vary by  site within the sub-group of GU-RMS.&nbsp; Specifically,  vaginal and paratesticular RMS enjoy a better prognosis than bladder/prostate  RMS.</p>
  <p><em><u>Epidemiology/Risk  Factors</u></em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly  75% of GU-RMS cases are diagnosed before the age of 5 years, with a 3.3:1 male  predominance.<a href="#_ENREF_6" title="Ferrer, 2006 #11">6</a>&nbsp; The age of diagnosis impacts prognosis  independently from tumor histology, and patients who are &lt;1 year and &gt;10  years old have a worse event-free survival rate compared to those between 1 and  9 years of age (53% and 51%, vs. 71%, respectively).<a href="#_ENREF_7" title="Joshi, 2004 #3">7</a>&nbsp; There are established risk factors for  developing RMS and given the young age of those affected; these are mostly  congenital as opposed to acquired risk factors.&nbsp;  Costello Syndrome, Gorlin&rsquo;s basal cell nevus syndrome, Rubinstein&ndash;Taybi  syndrome, trisomy 21 syndrome, Beckwith&ndash;Wiedemann syndrome, and fetal alcohol  syndrome have all been associated with RMS.<a href="#_ENREF_8" title="Malempati, 2012 #22">8</a>&nbsp; Two genetic conditions require particular  mention: (1) Neurofibromatosis is the most common syndrome in which RMS has  been described. From the patients enrolled in the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma  Study IV (IRS IV), the incidence of neurofibromatosis was 0.5%.<a href="#_ENREF_9" title="Sung, 2004 #23">9</a>&nbsp; (2) The Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a germline  mutation of the <em>TP53 </em>tumor suppressor gene and is transmitted in an  autosomal dominant manner. &nbsp;An increased  incidence of RMS has been found in association with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome as  have other solid tumors in childhood, including adrenocortical carcinoma.<a href="#_ENREF_10" title="Malkin, 1990 #24">10</a>&nbsp; Environmental factors associated with RMS  include radiation exposure and prior chemotherapy with alklyating agents. &nbsp;The increased risk of secondary malignancies  in those patients with neurofibromatosis and Li&ndash;Fraumeni syndromes after  treatment with alkylating agents and radiation therapy for RMS draws a link  between genetics and environment. &nbsp;It is  therefore desirable to limit the use of alkylating agents and radiotherapy in  these particular populations.<a href="#_ENREF_11" title="Ruymann, 1988 #25">11</a> <br>

  <p><em><u>Tumor  Biology/Genetics</u></em><br>
  </p>
  <p>The  histology of RMS consists of small round blue cells, with varying numbers of  spindle cells resembling fetal skeletal muscle.&nbsp;  The Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG) has developed a  pathology classification recognizing three major his&shy;tologic groups that have  prognostic significance.<a href="#_ENREF_12" title="Asmar, 1994 #26">12</a> &nbsp;(1) Embryonal  histology, which is favorable, accounts for 90% of genitourinary RMS. &nbsp;(2) Botryoid histology, which is often seen in  bladder and vaginal RMS, is essentially a variant of E-RMS.&nbsp; (3) Alveolar histology accounts for the  remaining 10% of GU-RMS and is associated with the worst outcomes.<a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Meza, 2006 #18">3</a>&nbsp; E-RMS may occur in a solid form arising in muscle  groups, such as the trunk and extremities, or as sarcoma botryoides, a polypoid  variety that occurs in hollow organs or body cavities, such as the bladder or  vagina.&nbsp; There is a spindle cell, or  leiomyomatous, variant seen frequently in the parates&shy;ticular region. The  botryoid and spindle cell variants of E-RMS are associated with an excellent  sur&shy;vival. &nbsp; <br>
The  pathologic diagnosis of RMS goes beyond basic histologic classification and is  complimented by such techniques as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and cytogenetics.&nbsp; Specifically, IHC staining has been helpful  in the diagnosis and prognosis of A-RMS.&nbsp;  A-RMS demonstrates high levels  of myogenin staining, whereas E- RMS is either negative or has only low-level  staining.<a href="#_ENREF_13" title="Dias, 2000 #27">13</a>&nbsp;  Subsequently, diffuse myogenin staining has been demonstrated as  predictive of decreased survival independent of tumor stage, site or histology.<a href="#_ENREF_14" title="Heerema-McKenney, 2008 #28">14</a>&nbsp; Additionally, E-RMS and A-RMS have been noted  to have distinct cytogenetic abnormali&shy;ties. &nbsp;A-RMS is associated with a translocation  between chro&shy;mosomes 1 or 2 and 13, resulting in the formation of a chimeric  protein. &nbsp;PAX3, a DNA-binding protein on  chromo&shy;some 2, or PAX7, a DNA-binding protein and on chromosome 1, is fused to the  FKHR gene on chromosome 13.<a href="#_ENREF_15" title="Gordon, 2001 #29">15</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_16" title="Anderson, 2001 #30">16</a> &nbsp; Expression of t(2;13), PAX3-FKHR is an  adverse prognostic factor for children presenting with meta&shy;static A-RMS. &nbsp;In addition, patients with the t(1;13)  translocation, <em>PAX7-FKHR </em>fusion, are often younger and have a better  prognosis than do their counterparts with the t(2;13), <em>PAX3-FKHR </em>fusion  abnormality.<a href="#_ENREF_16" title="Anderson, 2001 #30">16</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_17" title="Sorensen, 2002 #32">17</a> &nbsp; This has led some to propose a modified  risk-stratification which includes this translocation status.<a href="#_ENREF_18" title="Missiaglia, 2012 #17">18</a>&nbsp; However, analysis of a large series of cases  consistently fails to show an absolute association of PAX-FHKR translocations  with A-RMS; at least 25% of these tumors possess classic alveolar histology but  lack a translocation. &nbsp;In contrast, E-RMS  does not demonstrate recurrent chromosomal translocations.&nbsp; Instead, they show greater genomic  instability and recurring allelic imbalances such as loss of heterozygosity  (LOH) at chromosome 11p15.5.&nbsp; This is at  a different location than the <em>WT2 </em>gene implicated in the development of  some Wilms tumors.<a href="#_ENREF_19" title="Davicioni, 2009 #33">19</a> &nbsp;This region is the location of the <em>IGF-2 </em>gene. &nbsp;IGF-2 over-expression has been  documented in both A-RMS and E-RMS. &nbsp;&nbsp;IGF-2  is a growth factor that can stimulate the growth of RMS tumor cells, and  antibodies directed against IGF-2 can inhibit tumor growth.<a href="#_ENREF_20" title="El-Badry, 1990 #34">20</a> &nbsp;Amplification of the transcription  factor N-<em>MYC </em>has been noted in RMS, and over-expression of N-<em>MYC </em>was  associated with an adverse outcome in A-RMS.<a href="#_ENREF_21" title="Williamson, 2005 #35">21</a>&nbsp; In summary, utilizing these advanced, adjunctive  techniques to standard histopathology, classification based on gene expression  is possible using as few as five genes with an estimated error rate of less  than 5%.<a href="#_ENREF_19" title="Davicioni, 2009 #33">19</a>&nbsp; To that end, the next round of Children&rsquo;s  Oncology Group (COG) studies for RMS will likely use translocation fusion  status as the superseding biologic risk factor rather than embryonal or  alveolar histology, i.e. alveolar histology with no translocation fusion will  be managed just as an E-RMS tumor.</p>
  <p><em><u>Staging/Grouping/Risk  Classification of GU-RMS</u></em><br>
    The  approach to classifying patients with RMS can initially appear  complicated.&nbsp; However, utilizing the  important factors predictive of outcome these systems attempt to logically  &ldquo;stage&rdquo; the patients pre-surgically, &ldquo;group&rdquo; them based on completeness of  resection, and &ldquo;risk&rdquo; stratify them based on histology, stage, and group  (Tables I, II, and III).&nbsp; The Tumor-Node-Metastasis  (TNM) system segregates patients by favorable and unfavorable sites and is now  used in an integrated IRSG Staging. &nbsp;Favorable GU sites include paratesticular and Vaginal/Cervical/Uterine.  &nbsp;Unfavorable GU sites are bladder and  prostate. &nbsp;The presence of distant  metastases at diagnosis, involved regional lymph nodes (LNs), and large primary  tumors (&gt;5 cm) at unfavorable sites are rela&shy;tively unfavorable prognostic  signs.<a href="#_ENREF_22" title="Lawrence, 1997 #36">22</a>&nbsp; One important item to note when assessing  individual patients is that the post-surgical grouping is dependent to a large  extent on the completeness of surgical excision. &nbsp;As the treatment of GU-RMS has evolved, more  patients with Bladder/Prostate RMS undergo biopsy-only at the initial surgical  procedure, leaving gross residual disease. This results in the shifting of more  patients from group I to group III. Therefore, theoretically equivalent tumors  could end up in different groups, depending on the aggressiveness of the  initial surgical resection.&nbsp; IRSG and  current COG RMS studies group patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk  groups. &nbsp;This risk-classification  combines both the clinical grouping and TNM systems with the addition of  histology. &nbsp;The system attempts to classify  patients based on the various prog&shy;nostic variables known to predict outcomes.&nbsp; One recent change to this system occurred  with COG Study ARST0431 which included all ages of Stage IV E-RMS in the  high-risk group.&nbsp; Formerly, Stage IV  E-RMS patients under the age of 10 years-old were considered intermediate-risk.</p>
  <p><em><u>General  Treatment Paradigm</u></em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The treatment of GU-RMS has evolved away from radical  surgical excision towards organ sparing approaches when possible. &nbsp;Once it was demonstrated that most patients  would survive the disease, investigators explored the use of primary  chemotherapy and radiation therapy to avoid the surgical exenteration generally  employed for GU-RMS.&nbsp; The most recent  studies have thus focused on further morbidity and therapy reduction.&nbsp; The current round of COG studies has recently  concluded and results will be anticipated in the coming years.&nbsp; For low-risk patients with  embryonal/botryoid/spindle-cell RMS, ARST0331 opened in 2004. &nbsp;This study evaluated reducing the duration of  chemo&shy;therapy for low-stage, favorable-site tumors.&nbsp; The study for intermediate-risk patients,  ARST0531, evaluated the role of earlier radiation. <br>
While  the trend has generally been towards therapy reduction, studies have occasionally  indicated that therapy needs to be intensified.&nbsp;  For example, while it appears that boys less than 10 years of age with  paratesticular RMS can safely have their retroperitoneum staged with  cross-sectional imaging, those &ge; 10 years-old are under-staged with imaging  alone.&nbsp; Thus, a staging ipsilateral  retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is mandated in that age group.<a href="#_ENREF_23" title="Stewart, 2003 #15">23</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_24" title="Wiener, 2001 #19">24</a> &nbsp; Likewise, therapeutic intensification is under  investigation for those who experienced poor outcomes in prior studies.&nbsp; ARST0431, the study for high-risk patients,  investigated more intensive chemotherapy regimens in an attempt to improve  survival in this population.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Paratesticular  RMS</strong><br>
      <em><u>Background</u></em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paratesticular RMS (PT-RMS) makes up 5 to 10% of all new  RMS diagnoses and occurs in a bimodal age distribution, with approximately 1/3rd  being diagnosed between age 1 to 5 years-old and another 1/3rd  diagnosed after 10 years of age.<a href="#_ENREF_25" title="Wiener, 1994 #38">25</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_26" title="Ferrari, 2002 #19">26</a> &nbsp; PT-RMS arises in the muscle of the distal  portion of the spermatic cord and may invade the testis or surrounding tissues.  Presentation is often a unilateral painless scrotal swelling or mass that is  distinct from the testis. Because of this superficial location and the ease  with which it can be examined and noted, PT-RMS is usually detected and  diagnosed earlier.&nbsp; For example, 60 to 80% of PT tumors are stage  1, compared with 10 to 15% of all primary RMS locations.<a href="#_ENREF_26" title="Ferrari, 2002 #19">26</a> &nbsp;More than  90% of PT-RMS cases have embryonal histology and a good prognosis. &nbsp;However, regardless of histology, it is  considered a favorable location because even patients with alveolar PT-RMS have  a better prognosis than other alveo&shy;lar RMS primaries.<a href="#_ENREF_27" title="Ferrari, 2004 #20">27</a><strong> </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em><u>Clinical  Presentation and Initial Management</u></em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PT-RMS is typically noted by the patient or family as a  painless scrotal mass which may or may not be distinct from the testicle.&nbsp; The clinical approach to this situation  involves a thorough history and physical exam followed by serum tumor markers  to evaluate for a primary testicular malignancy (AFP, bHCG, LDH) as well as a  scrotal ultrasound to attempt to distinguish between a testicular or  paratesticular primary location.&nbsp; Of  note, the physical exam should specifically note any apparent invasion of the  scrotal wall as well as any inguinal or cervical lymphadenopathy.&nbsp; Staging consists of serum electrolytes,  complete blood count, liver function tests, and bilateral bone marrow  aspirates/biopsies.&nbsp; Additional staging  includes cross-sectional imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis specifically  investigating for the presence of enlarged retroperitoneal LNs or other  metastatic sites (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).&nbsp;<br>

  <p>Sagittal abdominal CT images of massive  lymphadenopathy in a boy with paratesticular RMS</p>
  <p> Bone scans have traditionally been part of  staging at diagnosis per the cooperative study group protocols; however, recent  investigation suggests that FDG-PET scans can be of more benefit in staging and  for future comparison during and after treatment to evaluate for therapeutic  effectiveness (<strong>Figure 2</strong>).<a href="#_ENREF_28" title="Federico, 2013 #41">28</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_29" title="Burnette, 2013 #42">29</a> </p>

  <p><em><u>Orchiectomy</u></em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the presence or absence of metastatic  disease on staging imaging, the next step in management is excision of the  primary which should always be approached by radical inguinal orchiectomy.&nbsp; There is no role for scrotal exploration for  excision and such surgery would then mandate a secondary excision of this  scrotal scar as well as an inguinal incision to resect the remaining inguinal  spermatic cord.&nbsp; Completeness of this  resection will impact further management including radiation dosing.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em><u>Adjuvant  Therapy</u></em><br>
    <em>RPLND</em><br>
Additional  surgery at this point depends on the patient&rsquo;s age and the initial staging  imaging.&nbsp; Prior studies investigated  forgoing staging ipsilateral RPLND; however, they demonstrated that those boys  10 years of age and older were at higher risk of being understaged by imaging  alone than those under 10 years of age.<a href="#_ENREF_23" title="Stewart, 2003 #15">23</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_24" title="Wiener, 2001 #19">24</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_30" title="Crist, 2001 #22">30</a> Thus, current recommendations are to perform ipsilateral RPLND for all boys 10 years  of age or older.&nbsp; The RPLND can be done  in the traditional, open fashion, or via minimally-invasive techniques by  surgeons experienced with such an approach.<a href="#_ENREF_31" title="Tomaszewski, 2010 #20">31</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_32" title="Cost, 2012 #21">32</a> &nbsp;Additionally, boys of any age who are  found to have retroperitoneal metastases should receive RPLND. &nbsp;The exception to this treatment plan is in the  presence of bulky lymph node involvement (more than 2 masses greater than  2cm).&nbsp; In the setting of such advanced  disease on imaging, biopsy can confirm metastasis to allow for appropriate  staging and prompt initiation of therapy.&nbsp;  Completion RPLND after induction chemotherapy is indicated if the first  cycles of chemotherapy have allowed for enough reduction that an RPLND could  safely remove all gross disease.&nbsp; If this  metastatic RMS is resected from the retroperitoneum, dose-adjusted radiotherapy  is then administered.&nbsp; If these  retroperitoneal metastases are not resected, radiation at 5040cGy is given to  the residual masses and RPLND to resect this residual may again be considered  at the completion of all chemotherapy and radiation if such masses are still  radiographically apparent.&nbsp; </p>

    Currently  there are studies underway to assess chemotherapy reduction for embryonal PT-RMS  patients because they generally represent a low-risk population.&nbsp; Similarly, there are studies investigating  dose intensification for alveolar PT-RMS.&nbsp;  However, these recommendations in this chapter follow the most current  standards of care.&nbsp; Regardless of  histology, PT-RMS patients who are either N0 or N1, by imaging if less than 10  years-old or by RPLND if 10 years of age or older, and have no evidence of  non-nodal distant metastasis are treated with 45 weeks of Vincristine, Actinomycin-D,  and Cyclophosphamide (VAC).&nbsp; Of note, RMS  patients may often receive Cyclophosphamide or Ifosfamide and are at risk for  hemorrhagic cystitis and other late bladder effects and are thus managed with  hyperhydration and Mesna at the time of chemotherapy administration.<br>
    Stage  1 Group I patients (N0) do not require radiotherapy.&nbsp; Local Group II PT-RMS patients represent  those who have had local spillage at the paratesticular site.&nbsp; These patients require radiotherapy to this  local site, which would traditionally be 4140cGy.&nbsp; However, if bulk disease remains at the  primary site, second-look surgery should be considered, which may include hemi-scrotectomy,  in order to obtain resection of residual disease.&nbsp; This would allow dose reduction to 3600cGy to  the PT site if complete resection is obtained.&nbsp;  Additionally, just as any patient with PT-RMS, if Local Group II  patients also have evidence of metastatic retroperitoneal LNs they will additionally  require retroperitoneal radiotherapy.&nbsp;  The dose of radiation to the retroperitoneum depends on the status of  these nodes.&nbsp; If the LNs are grossly  excised at RPLND and are positive (Retroperitoneal Group II), this dose is  4140cGy.&nbsp; However, if there is gross  residual disease in the retroperitoneum (Group III) either by incomplete  excision or biopsy-only, this dose is increased to 5040cGy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For widely metastatic disease (i.e. not only in the  retroperitoneum), the treatment paradigm is quite different.&nbsp; These patients are considered high-risk  regardless of their histology.&nbsp; Formerly,  the Stage 4 patients under the age of 10 years with E-RMS were considered to be  intermediate-risk.&nbsp; On the current  studies these patients are included in with all histologies and Stage 4 Group  IV disease to be classified as high-risk.&nbsp;  These patients are to undergo a radical inguinal orchiectomy for  diagnosis followed by enrollment on study.&nbsp;  All such patients now receive 51 weeks of intensive chemotherapy with VAC  plus Irinotecan, Ifosfamide, Etoposide, and Doxorubicin.&nbsp; The radiotherapy plan depends on the presence  and volume of metastatic disease in the retroperitoneum and the completeness of  resection at the time of orchiectomy.&nbsp; As  mentioned earlier, staging RPLND has a role in assessing retroperitoneal  spread, except in those patients with bulky disease (more than 2 masses greater  than 2cm).&nbsp; In the setting of more  advanced disease on imaging, initial retroperitoneal mass biopsy can confirm  metastasis and allow prompt risk-assessment and initiation of therapy.&nbsp; Completion RPLND after induction chemotherapy  is indicated if the first 20 weeks of chemotherapy allow for enough disease  reduction that RPLND could remove all gross disease.&nbsp; If this metastatic RMS is resected, radiotherapy  is then administered.&nbsp; However, if these  retroperitoneal metastases are not resected, radiation at 5040cGy is first  given to these residual nodes.&nbsp; RPLND for  resection of this residual may again be considered at the completion of the 51  weeks of chemotherapy if still such masses are radiographically apparent.&nbsp; All other non-nodal sites of metastasis are  given 5040cGy of radiation.<br>
    As  for the local control in the setting of Stage IV disease, this is similar to  those with Stage I disease.&nbsp; That is, if  there is spillage at the time of the orchiectomy and gross disease remains, a  second operation which may include hemiscrotectomy to resect this disease can  allow for a reduction in radiotherapy required at the local site.&nbsp; For patients with PT-RMS and completely  resected disease at the primary paratesticular site from a radical inguinal  orchiectomy with negative margins, no PT radiation is given.&nbsp; For those who have paratesticular microscopic  or gross residual disease radiation is administered to the inguinal and scrotal  fields.</p>
  <p><em><u>Prognosis</u></em><br>
The  prognosis for patients with PT-RMS is generally excellent in the setting of localized  disease (Stage 1 Group I-III).<a href="#_ENREF_26" title="Ferrari, 2002 #19">26</a>&nbsp; The best prognosis is seen in those with  Stage 1 Group I and II disease where the overall survival (OS) and event-free  survival (EFS) are 94 to 96% and 91 to 95%, respectively.&nbsp; Those with Group III disease have a slightly  worse prognosis with 5-year EFS and OS of 75% and 76%, respectively.&nbsp; These outcomes appear to be somewhat  independent of alveolar or embryonal histology.<a href="#_ENREF_27" title="Ferrari, 2004 #20">27</a>&nbsp; Patients with alveolar PT-RMS and localized  disease (Stage 1 Group I-III) had a 5-year EFS and OS of 78% and 89%,  respectively.<a href="#_ENREF_27" title="Ferrari, 2004 #20">27</a>&nbsp; However, it remains to be seen whether these  alveolar PT-RMS patients are more likely to have the t(1;13) translocation, <em>PAX7-FKHR </em>fusion which may not be associated with poor outcomes more typical of the  older&nbsp; patients with extremity A-RMS  which generally have the t(2;13), <em>PAX3-FKHR </em>fusion abnormality.&nbsp; Regardless of such histopathologic  risk-assessment, patients with metastatic Stage IV disease have a worse  prognosis with a 5-year OS reported as approximately 20 to 25%.<a href="#_ENREF_26" title="Ferrari, 2002 #19">26</a> <br>

  <p><strong>Bladder  and/or Prostate</strong><br>
      <em><u>Epidemiology </u></em><br>
    Bladder  and/or prostate (B/P) are the most common sites of GU-RMS, accounting for ~5%  of all RMS.&nbsp; RMS is the most common  bladder neoplasm in children under 10 years of age; the median age of children  presenting with B/P RMS is 5 years.<a href="#_ENREF_30" title="Crist, 2001 #22">30</a>&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em><u>Clinical  Presentation and Initial Evaluation </u></em><br>
    B/P  RMS typically presents with hematuria, stranguria, urinary frequency, and/or  acute urinary retention.<a href="#_ENREF_33" title="Meir, 2004 #3">33</a>&nbsp; As a general rule, a preschool-aged boy with  acute urinary retention should be considered to be at high risk of RMS, and should  be worked up accordingly.&nbsp; In girls with  an intraluminal sarcoma botryoides RMS, tumor may be visibly prolapsing at the  urethral meatus (<strong>Figure 3</strong>).&nbsp;Physical exam findings on two girls with sarcoma  botryoides variant of RMS </p>
  <p><img src="2014/Figure 3a.png" width="700" height="704"></p>
  <p><img src="2014/Figure 3b copy.png" width="700" height="525"></p>
  <p> On physical exam, a palpable lower abdominal  mass is often present, representing the mass itself, a distended bladder, or  both.&nbsp; Prostatic RMS in particular is  typically palpable on rectal examination.&nbsp; <br>
    Differentiating  between bladder and prostate as the primary site of origin from which a large  RMS arose can be quite challenging.&nbsp; In  general, prostatic primaries are more likely to be large, solid masses. By  contrast, bladder RMS primaries tend to occur as the sarcoma botryoides form (<strong>Figure 4</strong>);</p>
  <p> these tumors are frequently  located at the trigone or bladder neck.<a href="#_ENREF_34" title="Hays, 1982 #6">34</a>&nbsp; <br>
    The  initial evaluation of a child with suspected B/P RMS should consist of  ultrasound if an abdominal mass is not palpable.&nbsp; If tumor or a distended bladder can be  palpated, or if an initial ultrasound reveals a suspicious mass, then  cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI should be performed in order to  determine the extent of local tumor (<strong>Figure  5</strong>). In addition, these modalities can evaluate the retroperitoneum for  evidence of lymphatic or distant metastatic spread.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em><u>Treatment</u></em><br>
      <em>Initial  Surgical Management</em><br>
    Historically,  the usual treatment of B/P RMS was surgical excision via radical  cystoprostatectomy or, more commonly, pelvic exenteration.<a href="#_ENREF_35" title="Lerner, 1995 #2">35</a>&nbsp; Beginning with the IRSG studies in the 1970s,  however, chemotherapy and radiation began to supplant surgery as the mainstay  of treatment.&nbsp; Indeed, a major goal of  IRS-II (1978-1984) was to preserve a functional urinary tract.&nbsp; This focus has sharpened in more recent  years.<a href="#_ENREF_36" title="Arndt, 2004 #7">36</a>&nbsp; Currently, the major components of surgical  management are an initial biopsy (ideally by endoscopic or percutaneous means),  followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and lastly, if needed and if  feasible, exenterative surgery.&nbsp; <br>
    Diagnosis  of B/P RMS obviously requires pathological review of an adequate sample of  tumor tissue.&nbsp; Depending on the size and  location of the tumor, this should be accomplished by minimally-invasive means  such as transurethral resection (the preferred method if feasible), percutaneous  needle biopsy, or ultrasound-guided transrectal or transperineal biopsy.&nbsp; Occasionally, these methods are not feasible,  in which case an open biopsy may be necessary via a low midline or pfannenstiel  incision.&nbsp; In such cases, an attempt at  lymph node sampling (such as the iliac or obturator nodes) is recommended in  order to improve staging accuracy.&nbsp; <br>
    In  cases when the tumor can be completely excised with minimal morbidity &ndash; for  example, in a patient with a small RMS at the dome of the bladder &ndash; then  consideration can be given to partial cystectomy with wide local margins.<a href="#_ENREF_37" title="Merguerian, 1998 #10">37</a>&nbsp; A significant advantage to this approach is  that, if completed with negative margins, the patient may be able to retain a  relatively normal bladder.&nbsp; In IRS-IV,  this strategy was successfully applied in a number of patients, with 13 of 17  children undergoing initial partial cystectomy having no evidence of disease at  long-term follow-up.&nbsp; Radiation therapy  was required in 10 of these patients, however, with implications for postoperative  bladder function.<a href="#_ENREF_36" title="Arndt, 2004 #7">36</a> </p>
  <p>If the tumor is  sufficiently large to obstruct the ureter(s) and or bladder drainage, then  temporary urinary diversion should be performed via a JJ ureteral stent,  percutaneous nephrostomy tube, and/or Foley catheter as appropriate.<a href="#_ENREF_33" title="Meir, 2004 #3">33</a></p>
  <p><em>Pretreatment  Re-Excision (PRE)</em><br>
In  rare cases, pretreatment re-excision (PRE) &ndash; often by partial cystectomy,  cystectomy, or cystoprostatectomy &ndash; may be considered if a complete excision is  feasible.&nbsp; Although pretreatment  re-excision may not infrequently be necessary in non-RMS tumors,<a href="#_ENREF_38" title="Chui, 2002 #8">38</a> this treatment is not typically employed in B/P RMS.&nbsp; That said, patients managed with an unplanned  or incomplete excision in whom PRE can render the patient disease-free, are  potentially candidates for this approach.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em>Second  Look Operation (SLO)</em></p>
  <p>Following  chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, residual masses may be present.&nbsp; A second-look procedure is frequently  necessary in such cases, including but not limited to cystoscopy, biopsy,  exploration, partial cystectomy, cystoprostatectomy, or prostatectomy.&nbsp; In IRS-IV, 53 of 88 B/P RMS patients  ultimately required at least 1 second-look operation.<a href="#_ENREF_36" title="Arndt, 2004 #7">36</a>&nbsp; Assessing the completeness of therapeutic  response, however, can be challenging.&nbsp;  Mature rhabdomyoblasts are not infrequently present in post-treatment  biopsies, and these can be easily confused with active disease (particularly on  frozen section biopsy).&nbsp; Although there  is a generally low recurrence rate from mature rhabdomyoblasts,<a href="#_ENREF_39" title="Heyn, 1997 #13">39</a> deaths have been reported  following this diagnosis.<a href="#_ENREF_40" title="Leuschner, 2001 #14">40</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em><u>Post-treatment  Bladder Function</u></em><br>
As  noted above, B/P RMS patients are managed with intensive surgery, chemotherapy  and/or radiation therapy.&nbsp; Radiation  therapy, in particular, has a particularly important role in B/P RMS  algorithms.&nbsp; In both IRS-IV and the SIOP  MMT89 protocol, higher local recurrence rates were noted in patients who did  not receive radiation.<a href="#_ENREF_36" title="Arndt, 2004 #7">36</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_41" title="Stevens, 2005 #11">41</a> &nbsp; However, OS rates were similar between those  who did and did not receive radiation.<a href="#_ENREF_41" title="Stevens, 2005 #11">41</a>&nbsp; However, radiation therapy can have a  substantial impact on bladder function.&nbsp;  In IRS-IV, 55% of event-free, surviving patients were reported to have  &ldquo;preserved&rdquo; bladder function.&nbsp; However,  this figure was determined based on patient questionnaire only, and only 1  child underwent formal urodynamics testing.<a href="#_ENREF_36" title="Arndt, 2004 #7">36</a>&nbsp; In a smaller series reported by Yeung et al,  all patients who received pelvic irradiation had markedly abnormal urodynamic  profiles, specifically reduced functional capacity and atypical voiding curves.<a href="#_ENREF_42" title="Yeung, 1994 #52">42</a>&nbsp; Among all children with B/P RMS in IRS-IV,  only 40% were event-free with normal functioning bladders &ndash; and as noted above,  this is likely an overestimate given the lack of formal urodynamic assessments  in these children.<a href="#_ENREF_36" title="Arndt, 2004 #7">36</a>&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p>Abnormalities  in bladder function may arise secondary to surgical (e.g. nerve damage, partial  cystectomy) or medical management.<a href="#_ENREF_43" title="Ozkan, 2006 #49">43-45</a> &nbsp;Typical presenting complaints include  lower urinary tract symptoms, including enuresis; the latter may be more common  in children with a history of genitourinary RMS than in survivors of other  childhood cancers.<a href="#_ENREF_42" title="Yeung, 1994 #52">42</a>&nbsp; Evaluation should include not only an  assessment of symptom severity and bother, but also integrity of the upper  tracts, as abnormal elimination habits (whether in the storage or voiding  phase, or both) may place renal units already exposed to chemotherapy and/or  radiation at risk.&nbsp; <br>
Hemorrhagic  cystitis, which often develops acutely in patients receiving chemotherapy with  alkylating agents, may also present as a late effect, with a widely variable  presentation.<a href="#_ENREF_46" title="Ritchey, 2009 #53">46</a>&nbsp; Radiation- and chemotherapy-induced cystitis  is correlated histologically with local tissue hypoxia, ischemia, and  necrosis.&nbsp; Cyclophosphamide and its  metabolite acrolein are considered the classic etiologic agents, but other  chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. dactinomycin and doxorubicin) may act  synergistically to increase the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis.<a href="#_ENREF_47" title="Heyn, 1992 #54">47-49</a> &nbsp;Furthermore, agents acting to decrease the  toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. MESNA, N-acetylcysteine) do not  entirely eliminate the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis.&nbsp; Patients receiving pelvic radiation appear to  be at increased risk of hemorrhagic cystitis, particularly when doses exceed  3000cGy for whole bladder exposure and 6000cGy for partial bladder exposure.<a href="#_ENREF_50" title="Tefft, 1976 #57">50</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_51" title="Mangar, 2006 #58">51</a> &nbsp; Doses exceeding 4500cGy are associated with  more consistent development of radiation cystitis.<a href="#_ENREF_51" title="Mangar, 2006 #58">51</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_52" title="Hays, 1995 #59">52</a> &nbsp; Even when the acute presentation is  successfully managed (e.g. bleeding is stopped), hemorrhagic cystitis,  decreased bladder compliance may result in late effects including urinary  symptoms and altered lower tract function.<a href="#_ENREF_53" title="Jerkins, 1988 #60">53</a> <br>
Urinary  diversion is not infrequently required in B/P RMS, either due to initial or  delayed cystectomy or to radiation-related loss of bladder function.&nbsp; However, good quality of life can be restored  to these patients.<a href="#_ENREF_54" title="Filipas, 2004 #12">54</a>&nbsp; Many authors advocate for the use of initial  incontinent urinary diversion, either by ileal or colonic conduits,<a href="#_ENREF_55" title="Duel, 1996 #15">55</a> while others have reported good outcomes following an immediate orthotopic  continent diversion.<a href="#_ENREF_37" title="Merguerian, 1998 #10">37</a>&nbsp; Initial continent urinary diversion bears a  particular set of challenges, however: first, any postoperative complication is  likely to delay chemotherapy, and continent diversion is generally accepted to  have a higher complication rate than incontinent diversions<a href="#_ENREF_56" title="van Hemelrijck, 2013 #16">56</a>;  second, as noted above frozen section is unreliable at assessing the adequacy  of surgical margins<a href="#_ENREF_37" title="Merguerian, 1998 #10">37</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_40" title="Leuschner, 2001 #14">40</a> ;  third, if local recurrence does occur, a continent diversion makes adequate  treatment quite challenging<a href="#_ENREF_57" title="Castagnetti, 2013 #17">57</a>;  and fourth, given the age range in which B/P RMS occurs, it can be difficult to  gauge whether the child and/or family are capable of long-term, adequate  maintenance of their urinary diversion. Because of these specific challenges,  many authors recommend against immediate reconstruction unless further therapy  is highly unlikely and both the treating center and surgeon have extensive  experience with continent reconstructions.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients with intestinal substitutions (neobladder,  conduit, or augmentation cystoplasty) are at increased risk for metabolic  abnormalities (hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic acidosis with ileal and  colon conduits), calculi, and perforation.&nbsp;  Use of bowel in the genitourinary tract is also associated with an  increased risk of development of secondary malignancies, with the risk  typically increasing between 5-10 years after surgery.<a href="#_ENREF_58" title="Austen, 2004 #61">58</a>&nbsp; Patients with urinary diversions should be  assessed at least annually with upper tract imaging and labs (electrolytes,  BUN, and creatinine); given the time course for development of secondary  malignancies in this population, most urologists initiate annual cystoscopy and  urine cytology 5-7 years after diversion. Since treatment for RMS has  increasingly focused on organ preservation, urinary diversions are rarely  employed at present.</p>
  <p><em><u>Prognosis </u></em><br>
Unlike  other GU sites, B/P is considered to be an unfavorable site for RMS. As such,  B/P thus carries a worse prognosis than other sites and under the IRSG staging  system is &ndash; at best &ndash; considered to be Stage 2 before treatment.&nbsp; The EFS of B/P RMS in the IRS-IV trial was  77%; patients with non-metastatic disease had an OS of 82% at 6 years.&nbsp; However, there are groups with particularly  good prognoses after a diagnosis of B/P RMS; children with an endophytic  sarcoma botryoides tumor have been reported to have 10-year survival rates of  &gt;90%.<a href="#_ENREF_40" title="Leuschner, 2001 #14">40</a> </p>
  <p><strong>Vulvar/Vaginal/Uterine</strong><br>
      <em><u>Epidemiology</u></em><br>
    Gynecologic  malignancies are rare in children, and account for fewer than 1 in 20 childhood  tumors, and Most of these are vaginal RMS.<a href="#_ENREF_59" title="Hassan, 1999 #23">59</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_60" title="Hellman, 2004 #24">60</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;Although RMS in gynecologic sites accounts  for about 3.5% of all pediatric RMS,<a href="#_ENREF_61" title="Arndt, 2001 #25">61</a> these tumors are still extremely rare:&nbsp;  Fernandez reported 18 patients in 39 years at a single institution,<a href="#_ENREF_62" title="Fernandez-Pineda, 2011 #26">62</a> while Kirsch found only 67 cases of female pediatric genitourinary RMS in 33  years.<a href="#_ENREF_63" title="Kirsch, 2014 #27">63</a>&nbsp; While gynecologic RMS can occur at any age,  vaginal tumors are most common in toddlers and pre-school age children (with  diagnosis occurring at a mean age of 3.7 years in one study).<a href="#_ENREF_62" title="Fernandez-Pineda, 2011 #26">62</a>&nbsp; There is a bimodal distribution of female  patients with RMS, with the first peak between 1 to 4 years old (mostly vaginal  tumors) and another between 15 to 19 years old (mostly uterine/cervical primary  sites).<a href="#_ENREF_63" title="Kirsch, 2014 #27">63</a>&nbsp; Most patients (81%) are Caucasian, with a  minority being African American (13%) or Hispanic (2%).<a href="#_ENREF_61" title="Arndt, 2001 #25">61</a>&nbsp; Overall, the vagina and uterus/cervix are the  most common primary sites, although the exact proportions vary by study.&nbsp; Kirsch et al reported that the proportions were  relatively equal (42% vagina compared with 39% uterus/cervix), although a  review of IRS I-IV found the vagina as the primary site in 54% of patients,  compared with 17% for the uterus and 15% for the cervix.<a href="#_ENREF_61" title="Arndt, 2001 #25">61</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_63" title="Kirsch, 2014 #27">63</a> &nbsp; Given that these tumors are relatively  uncommon, sampling error could account for these disparate observations.&nbsp; <br>
    As  in other sites, the histology of gynecologic RMS may be either embryonal or  alveolar.&nbsp; Uterine and vaginal tumors tend  to be Group III or IV at presentation in most cases given the typical approach  with an initial biopsy-only, compared with vulvar tumors, which are typically  Group I or II because of the ability to offer upfront resection.&nbsp; The vast majority (50-67%) of embryonal  vaginal tumors are localized at diagnosis; in those that are metastatic, the  lung is most common site of distant disease.<a href="#_ENREF_64" title="Copeland, 1985 #28">64</a>&nbsp; Arndt reported 45% alveolar histology in  vulvar tumors.<a href="#_ENREF_61" title="Arndt, 2001 #25">61</a> &nbsp;Uterine tumors tended to be large and  invasive (&gt;5 cm in most cases) and were associated with nodal disease in  27%.&nbsp; In contrast, only one patient with  an invasive cervical RMS was identified in the IRS series,<a href="#_ENREF_61" title="Arndt, 2001 #25">61</a> and cervical RMS has, to date, never been associated with nodal disease.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em><u>Tumor  Biology</u></em><br>
RMS  is a small round blue cell tumor with differentiated skeletal muscle.<a href="#_ENREF_65" title="Qualman, 1998 #30">65</a>&nbsp; Vaginal tumors most typically have two  subtypes: botyroid (&ldquo;bunch of grapes&rdquo;) and embryonal.&nbsp; The botyroid appearance arises secondary to  tumor growth in the subepithelium of hollow organs, with resulting distortion  of the submucosal layer of spindle cells.<a href="#_ENREF_66" title="Newton, 1995 #31">66</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;The  alveolar variant of RMS is uncommon in vaginal/vulvar/uterine sites, but  portends poorer outcome except when associated with vulvar lesions (which tend  to be localized).<a href="#_ENREF_67" title="Scarpato, 2013 #32">67</a> </p>
  <p><em><u>Clinical  Presentation and Work Up</u></em><br>
    Diagnosis  typically occurs after patients present with symptoms, rather than as  incidental findings or prompted by screening.&nbsp;  Vaginal and uterine RMS most commonly present with bloody vaginal  discharge (67%) or a visible mass extending from the vagina (33%; <strong>Figure 3</strong>).<a href="#_ENREF_59" title="Hassan, 1999 #23">59</a>,<a href="#_ENREF_62" title="Fernandez-Pineda, 2011 #26">62</a>,<a href="#_ENREF_68" title="Grimsby, 2012 #33">68</a>&nbsp; The differential diagnosis of vulvar masses  also includes other vulvar malignancies (e.g. endodermal sinus tumor) or benign  vulvar growths (e.g. Gartner duct cysts, canal of Nuck cysts, and hamartoma).<a href="#_ENREF_69" title="Youngstrom, 2013 #29">69</a>&nbsp; In patients in whom the vulvar mass is not  readily identified as neoplastic, a karyotype should be considered, although of  course this should not delay diagnosis or treatment in patients in whom  neoplasia is suspected.&nbsp; Initial imaging  may consist of a pelvic ultrasound in order to delineate the size and extent of  the mass; if a neoplastic process is suspected, then cross sectional imaging of  the abdomen and pelvis with either a CT or MRI will help to determine the  extent of local and nodal disease.&nbsp; Since  the lungs and bone marrow are the most common sites of metastatic disease,  initial metastatic workup consists of a chest CT, bone marrow biopsy, and bone  scan.</p>

Historically  (until 1972), treatment consisted of pelvic exenteration, but IRS I/II  protocols (1972 and 1984, respectively) found that the vast majority of tumors  were exquisitely sensitive to chemotherapy.<a href="#_ENREF_70" title="Hays, 1985 #36">70</a>&nbsp; Following the IRS I/II protocols, only 12% of  patients required pelvic exenteration, meaning that uterine preservation could  be achieved in 88% of patients;<a href="#_ENREF_71" title="Andrassy, 1995 #37">71</a> on IRS III/IV, only 22% of patients underwent hysterectomy and 82% were alive 5  years after diagnosis.<a href="#_ENREF_61" title="Arndt, 2001 #25">61</a>&nbsp; Concurrently, a SIOP protocol open between  1984-1994 found a survival rate greater than 90% using multimodal therapy, and  a uterine preservation rate of 88% among survivors (with two deaths and three patients  requiring hysterectomy).<a href="#_ENREF_72" title="Martelli, 1999 #38">72</a>&nbsp; Based on these findings, present  recommendations are for upfront chemotherapy followed by surgical excision and  in some cases adjuvant radiotherapy.<a href="#_ENREF_71" title="Andrassy, 1995 #37">71</a>&nbsp; Pelvic exenteration is thus reserved for  patients with tumors refractory to chemotherapy and radiation.<br>
Following  chemotherapy, exploration is performed with complete tumor excision (when  possible) and possibly another biopsy to assess tumor viability.<a href="#_ENREF_61" title="Arndt, 2001 #25">61</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_68" title="Grimsby, 2012 #33">68</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_73" title="Rodeberg, 2002 #39">73</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_74" title="Breneman, 2012 #40">74</a> &nbsp; Local control is paramount as local  recurrence accounts for the vast majority of treatment failures. &nbsp;A 5 mm margin is considered sufficient for  oncologic control.<a href="#_ENREF_74" title="Breneman, 2012 #40">74</a>&nbsp; While complete resection should be performed  when possible (e.g. vaginal tumors may require hysterectomy), tumors extending  into the bladder or bowel should be completely resected only when organ  function can be preserved.<a href="#_ENREF_74" title="Breneman, 2012 #40">74</a> <br>
In  addition to radiographic evaluation, lymph nodes should also be assessed  pathologically.&nbsp; Vulvar lesions drain to  superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes, while vaginal and uterine tumors  drain to the pelvic lymph nodes.&nbsp; Surgical  complications are discussed in more detail below, and include rectovaginal or  vesicovaginal fistula and urinary incontinence, typically in patients with  extensive resections including pelvic exenteration.<a href="#_ENREF_62" title="Fernandez-Pineda, 2011 #26">62</a> </p>
  <p><em>Pretreatment  Re-Excision (PRE)</em><br>
    Pre-treatment  re-excision is typically employed for patients in whom a mass is &ldquo;completely&rdquo;  excised (e.g. not biopsied) prior to the diagnosis of RMS.&nbsp; Histologic evaluation of RMS in these cases  often will reveal positive margins and incomplete resection of the mass.&nbsp; Prior to administering adjuvant therapy,  re-excision of the mass with removal of any suspected residual tissue with a  wide local margin is appropriate.&nbsp; Lymph  node sampling, if not performed at the time of initial surgery, should also be  performed at this time.&nbsp; As with excision  following chemotherapy and radiotherapy, excision of organs, such as the  bladder, which may result in significant functional consequences to the patient,  should be avoided.<a href="#_ENREF_74" title="Breneman, 2012 #40">74</a> </p>
  <p><em>Second  Look Operation (SLO)</em><br>
Second  look operations are periodically undertaken to assess tumor burden and clinical  response following radiotherapy and chemotherapy; tumor excision may be  performed if it will result in a decrease in additional therapy (e.g.  radiation).&nbsp; Because vaginal and vulvar  RMS are typically highly responsive to chemotherapy, SLOs are rarely performed  for tumors in these sites.<a href="#_ENREF_74" title="Breneman, 2012 #40">74</a> </p>
  <p><em><u>Adjuvant  Treatment</u></em><br>
      <em>Chemotherapy/Radiation</em><br>
    Standard  chemotherapy for RMS is VAC.&nbsp; Patients  who did not receive Adriamcyin had a 15% recurrence rate, compared with  complete cure in patients given Adriamycin.&nbsp;  Ifosfamide is occasionally substituted for cyclophosphamide.&nbsp; Radiation is used for patients in whom there  is residual tumor following chemotherapy.&nbsp;  Historically, the dose has been 5040cGy for patients with gross disease  and 4140cGy for patients with microscopic disease.&nbsp; A recent COG study (D9602) set out to  determine whether comparable survival results to those seen in IRS III/IV could  be achieved with lower external beam radiotherapy doses (3600cGy in patients  with microscopic positive margins, 4140cGy in patients with nodal disease, and  5040cGy in patients with gross residual disease).<a href="#_ENREF_74" title="Breneman, 2012 #40">74</a>&nbsp; Girls with vaginal tumors accounted for the  majority of the treatment failures, with local control achieved in only half of  this subgroup, although many did not receive alkylating agents or radiotherapy,  making the reason for failure challenging to determine with certainty.&nbsp; Current COG protocols mandate radiation  therapy for group II and III vaginal tumors, with the intensity of radiotherapy  ranging from 3600-5040cGy depending on the extent of residual tumor.&nbsp; In these patients, the local failure rate is  increased without radiation.<a href="#_ENREF_75" title="Walterhouse, 2011 #41">75</a> <br>
    Radiation  failure appears to be most pronounced in children under 3 years of age,  possibly because of inadequate dosing related to the increased fear of  radiation-related late complications as well as decreased comprehension of and  cooperation with the goals of therapy.<a href="#_ENREF_76" title="Puri, 2006 #42">76</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_77" title="Raney, 1990 #43">77</a> &nbsp; Nonetheless, radiation failure appears to  unequivocally increase the risk for recurrence (70%) and death.&nbsp; Although not routinely used in the United  States, brachytherapy for pediatric vaginal and vulvar RMS has been employed in  Europe.<a href="#_ENREF_78" title="Magne, 2007 #44">78</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_79" title="Magne, 2008 #45">79</a> &nbsp; Magne et al. reported a high (91%) five-year  survival in 32 patients who received brachytherapy for residual disease, with  only two experiencing acute radiation-induced side effects.&nbsp; However, the vaginal stenosis rate in this group  was 20% over 8 years.</p>
  <p><em><u>Prognosis  and Follow Up</u></em><br>
Factors  portending an improved survival rate include young age (&lt;10 years), locally  confined disease, and chemotherapeutic treatment with VAC and (when  appropriate) radiation.<a href="#_ENREF_61" title="Arndt, 2001 #25">61</a>&nbsp; The vulva and vagina are considered favorable  sites.&nbsp; Tumors larger than 5 cm, or those  associated with local invasion or positive lymph nodes, were associated with  poorer outcomes.&nbsp; Children older than one  year had a better prognosis than infants, likely secondary to the ability to  tolerate therapy-related complications.<a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Meza, 2006 #18">3</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_80" title="Rodary, 1991 #46">80</a> &nbsp; Almost all deaths occurred in first 5 years  after diagnosis, but late relapse has been reported.<a href="#_ENREF_81" title="Vasquez, 2008 #47">81</a>&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em><u>Late  Effects</u></em><br>
    As  RMS treatment centers on organ preservation, late effects increasingly focus on  the sequelae of chemotherapy and radiotherapy rather than surgery.&nbsp; Spunt et al. observed multiple complaints in  patients treated for RMS, including reproductive issues (dyspareunia, vaginal  stenosis, vaginal fistula, endocrine effects, abnormal menstrual cycles,  premature menopause), genitourinary conditions (abnormal bladder function,  ureteral obstruction, pyelonephritis, urethral obstruction), and altered  gastrointestinal function (strictures, fistula, perforation, cholecystitis,  gastritis, fecal incontinence).<a href="#_ENREF_82" title="Spunt, 2005 #48">82</a>&nbsp; Although this list is extensive, the authors  cautioned that the late development of many complications (particularly in  patients receiving radiation) may mean that the true prevalence of late effects  is underestimated.&nbsp; In addition, at  present there are no standardized methods to assess pelvic floor integrity and  function in survivors of RMS, and so subtle bladder and bowel complaints may go  unreported.<br>
    While  the endocrine gonadal function is most commonly affected (e.g. premature  ovarian failure, especially with pelvic radiation), the most common  complications requiring surgical intervention were gynecologic complaints such  as strictures and fistulae.&nbsp; Fistulae  were universally associated with radiation therapy, with an equal proportion  developing spontaneously and post-surgically.&nbsp;  Vaginal stenosis can typically be managed with dilatation or more formal  surgical repair; the risks of the latter include bowel perforation and  recurrent stenosis, and so repair is typically undertaken only when  conservative management has failed or has an extremely low likelihood of  initial success.<br>
    Other  systems in which late effects have been observed include the musculoskeletal  system (scoliosis and tissue fibrosis), mental health issues (depression,  anxiety, insomnia, academic issues, substance abuse), and cardiovascular  (stroke, hypertension, doxorubicin-associated cardiomyopathy).&nbsp; Secondary neoplasms have a cumulative  incidence of 13.5% at 20 years; Spunt et al. reported on three patients, all of  whom developed secondary malignancies (osteosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma in  situ of the cervix, and colonic carcinoma) within the RMS radiation field.&nbsp; In this series, the proportion of patients  developing secondary neoplasms was higher than that for other groups of cancer  survivors, although it was unclear whether this finding was spurious given the  small number of affected patients, or representative of a truly increased risk  given the near-universal receipt of radiotherapy in that cohort.&nbsp; The likelihood of developing a late effect  was not correlated with the age at diagnosis of RMS.&nbsp; The authors did find that refinements in  therapy for RMS resulted in more late effects for patients treated after 1984 than  those before, but this was due only to an increase in the number of lower grade  (1 and 2) toxicity.&nbsp; <br>
Radiation  therapy is perhaps the single most important risk factor for the development of  late complications. In the aforementioned study of 26 patients by Spunt et al.,  only two had no late effects, both of whom were radiation-na&iuml;ve.&nbsp; Affected patients had an average of 4.5 late  effects, with a maximum of 14 per patient; patients with radiation had a median  of 9.5 late effects apiece compared with one late effect in patients who were  radiation-na&iuml;ve.&nbsp; The late effects were  also more severe in patients who had undergone radiotherapy, with more severe  (grade 3 to 4) effects reported in this group.&nbsp;  Over half (54%) underwent surgery to manage complications, with vaginal  dilatation being most common, followed by procedures to correct  gastrointestinal strictures and vaginal fistulae. The authors concluded that  radiation conferred a higher risk of treatment-related late complications in  children than in adults.&nbsp; Given the close  anatomic relationship in the pelvis between the gynecologic structures and the  bladder, many of the same bladder late effects can be seen as in B/P RMS which  were reviewed earlier.</p>
  <p><strong>Infertility</strong><br>
    While  fertility issues have been reported after treatment for many childhood cancers,  the literature specific to fertility issues following treatment for  vaginal/vulvar/uterine RMS remains scarce.&nbsp;  Fertility may be challenged due to chemotherapy exposure, radiation  therapy, and surgical intervention.&nbsp; Premature  ovarian failure, as already discussed, is a common finding following pelvic  radiation.&nbsp; In patients who have  undergone hysterectomy, the ability to carry a child is lost; however, even in  those in whom all or part of the uterus is preserved, post-surgical or post-radiation  changes may promote cervical incompetence or premature labor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Live births have been reported after  treatment for pelvic RMS, however.<a href="#_ENREF_83" title="Ariza, 1999 #62">83</a>&nbsp; Pregnancy rates following treatment for  sarcoma are moderate (47%) in at least one other study,<a href="#_ENREF_84" title="Mansky, 2007 #63">84</a> suggesting that the pelvic radiation and surgical sequelae are stronger  predictors of infertility than chemotherapy in girls.<br>
    In  males who have received chemotherapy, infertility issues have been reported  previously.&nbsp; One study described a 24%  paternity rate, with the majority of other patients having oligo- or  azoospermia.<a href="#_ENREF_84" title="Mansky, 2007 #63">84</a>&nbsp; Patients with successful paternity did not  have exposure to alkylating chemptherapy or pelvic radiation.&nbsp; Another study found universally  abnormal semen analyses in males exposed to cyclophosphamide prior to puberty.<a href="#_ENREF_85" title="Kenney, 2001 #64">85</a>&nbsp; The degree of oligo- or azoospermia was not  dose-dependent in this study.&nbsp; While most  patients did not have abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis  associated with the abnormal semen analyses, 40% of boys had elevated  luteinizing hormone levels despite normal testosterone, suggesting abnormal  Leydig cell function.&nbsp; It is possible  that ifosfamide may be less likely to cause significant fertility issues than  cyclophosphamide.<a href="#_ENREF_86" title="Ridola, 2009 #65">86</a>, <a href="#_ENREF_87" title="Oberlin, 2009 #66">87</a> </p>
  <p><strong>Rare  Primaries</strong><br>
    <em><u>Undistinguishable  Pelvic</u></em><br>
Pelvic  RMS not arising from one of the genitourinary organs is rare.&nbsp; At presentation, these tumors are often large  and extensive, encasing pelvic structures such as nerves and blood vessels.&nbsp; Just as with RMS clearly arising from a  discrete organ, treatment is aimed at optimizing the chance for complete  excision while minimizing damage to other organs and pelvic structures.<a href="#_ENREF_88" title="Hishiki, 2013 #67">88</a> </p>
  <p><em><u>Renal</u></em><br>
    Renal  RMS is rare and in a 33 year period, the multicenter IRS group enrolled only 10  renal sarcomas and specifically only six cases of renal primary RMS.<a href="#_ENREF_89" title="Raney, 2008 #68">89</a> &nbsp;Therefore, prompt and accurate diagnosis  requires a high index of suspicion and may be challenging.&nbsp; Both Wilms Tumor and renal cell carcinoma  should be excluded from the differential diagnosis.&nbsp; Myogenin and MyoD1 are skeletal muscle  markers which are considered both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of  RMS as both are expressed early in skeletal muscle differentiation.<a href="#_ENREF_90" title="Fanous, 2012 #69">90</a>&nbsp; While WT1 positivity may be seen, typically a  nuclear staining pattern is not seen in RMS as it is in WT.<a href="#_ENREF_91" title="Carpentieri, 2002 #70">91</a>&nbsp; Desmin is also a marker for RMS.<a href="#_ENREF_92" title="Morotti, 2006 #71">92</a> <br>
    A  retrospective review of renal primary RMS from the IRSG demonstrated that tumors  were generally large (median diameter ranged from 8 to 15 cm), although the  majority were noninvasive.&nbsp; Renal RMS had  a high incidence of anaplasia (67%), much higher than reported in other  childhood renal tumors or in RMS overall.&nbsp;  One of the six patients had nodal disease and two patients presented  with metastases.&nbsp; In this series, all  tumors were of the embryonal subtype.<a href="#_ENREF_89" title="Raney, 2008 #68">89</a> <br>
    As  with RMS in other primary locations, the extent of excision of renal RMS  appears to correlate with survival.&nbsp; COG  recommends complete primary excision of the tumor when possible, including  regional lymph node dissection for disease staging.&nbsp; Renal RMS is considered an unfavorable site.  &nbsp;In the 6 patient IRSG series,  initial treatment consisted of radical nephrectomy followed by 3 drug chemotherapy  (VAC) in most cases, with radiation reserved for patients with residual  disease.&nbsp; Three of six patients had  recurrent disease in the brain or bone, and died of disease.&nbsp; The other three were alive and NED more than  a decade after completing therapy.<a href="#_ENREF_89" title="Raney, 2008 #68">89</a>&nbsp; At present, biopsy followed by upfront  chemotherapy is advocated to facilitate tumor removal and maximally preserve  both affected and adjacent organs at the time of surgery.&nbsp; Following chemotherapy, radiation therapy can  be employed in patients with residual tumor (positive margins or nodal disease)  if the benefits outweigh the risks, even in the presence of abnormal abdominal  anatomy.<a href="#_ENREF_93" title="Walther, 2013 #72">93</a>&nbsp; However, in the IRSG series, even with  adjuvant radiotherapy, patients with nodal disease or metastases fared poorly.</p>
  <p><em><u>Retroperitoneal</u></em><br>
Retroperitoneal  RMS as a primary site is rare; together, retroperitoneal and non-genitourinary  pelvic RMS account for only 10% of all RMS,<a href="#_ENREF_94" title="Blakely, 2003 #73">94</a> and in one institutional series, only seven retroperitoneal-primary RMS were  recorded in a 30 year period.<a href="#_ENREF_95" title="Pham, 2007 #74">95</a>&nbsp; Tumors are typically identified after the  patient develops symptoms (often nonspecific, such as pain or abdominal discomfort),  and therefore many tumors are quite large (most are greater than 5 cm in  diameter at the time of diagnosis).&nbsp;  Retroperitoneal-primary RMS tumors also tend to be more locally  extensive; Pham et al. reported that only about one-third of patients had completely  localized disease: 62% had tumors affecting nearby organs, and although none  had distant metastases at diagnosis, 14% were found to have metastatic disease  over the course of treatment.<a href="#_ENREF_95" title="Pham, 2007 #74">95</a>&nbsp; Blakely et al. observed that 94% of tumors  were clinical group III or IV, and in children in whom invasion status was  recorded, 96% had invasive tumors.<a href="#_ENREF_94" title="Blakely, 2003 #73">94</a>&nbsp; <br>
Most  tumors are at the thoracolumbar level, with a significant minority at the  lumbosacral level.<a href="#_ENREF_95" title="Pham, 2007 #74">95</a>&nbsp; Boys and children younger than 5 years were  more commonly affected; in these groups, embryonal histology predominated,  although alveolar histology was more common in older (e.g. adolescent)  children. &nbsp;Improved failure-free and  overall survival was predicted by younger age at diagnosis, female gender, and  embryonal histology.&nbsp; Patients with  embryonal histology were more likely to undergo tumor debulking compared with  children with alveolar histology (who typically underwent biopsy alone);  surgical debulking, even when the tumor was not completely resected, was  correlated with improved survival.&nbsp; While  patients with RMS had substantially shorter survival than patients with other  types of sarcoma, the overall five-year survival was similar in patients with  and without RMS, although this finding might reflect the small number of  patients included.<br>
