  <p><strong>Phimosis</strong></p>
  <p>Phimosis  describes a condition whereby the prepuce cannot be retracted over the glans  due to a tight distal, preputial ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately  96% of newborn boys have physiologic phimosis, although by 3 years of age 90%  of foreskins can be retracted over the glans without difficulty; by the age of  17, less than 1% of men have phimosis.<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Gairdner, 1949 #92">1</a>,<a href="#_ENREF_2" title="Oster, 1968 #91">2</a> &nbsp;  Young boys often present with preputial adhesions in which the foreskin  is adherent to the glans; however they do not have the distal constricting  cicatrix of fibrotic tissue that defines true phimosis.&nbsp; In this setting, early forceful retraction of  the foreskin is not recommended, because recurrent adhesions may form between  the foreskin and denuded glandular tissue and propagate the formation of a  cicatrix at the tip of the foreskin, thereby causing secondary phimosis.</p>
  <p>When  physiologic phimosis is present, it may hinder adequate penile hygiene, which  may propagate balanitis or balanoposthitis, as well as repeated urinary tract  infections; among adults, this condition may predispose patients to the  transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and carcinoma of the penis.<a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Doyle, 2010 #120">3-8</a>&nbsp;  In terms of nonsurgical treatment options, the application of  corticosteroid cream to the phimotic band 3 to 4 times per day has been shown  to increase foreskin retractibility.<a href="#_ENREF_9" title="Yang, 2005 #130">9</a>&nbsp;  Specifically, in a study of 70 boys aged 1 to 12 years, the application  of betamethasone valerate 0.06% on this schedule resulted in a 81.3% response  rate, as measured by an improvement in foreskin retraction.<a href="#_ENREF_9" title="Yang, 2005 #130">9</a>&nbsp;  If phimosis recurs, a second course of topical steroids may be  beneficial.<a href="#_ENREF_10" title="Lund, 2005 #133">10</a>&nbsp;  However, in cases where steroid treatment has not been effective or in  the setting of recurrent urinary or skin infections, circumcision is the next  preferred option.&nbsp; <a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Tobian, 2009 #108">_ENREF_3</a><a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Wawer, 2011 #105">_ENREF_3</a><a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Elmore, 2002 #93">_ENREF_3</a><a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Oster, 1968 #91">_ENREF_1</a> <br>

  <p><strong>Inconspicuous Penile Disorders</strong></p>
  <p>The  term <em>inconspicuous penis</em> refers to a  group of conditions where the phallus appears to be diminutive in size.<a href="#_ENREF_11" title="Bergeson, 1993 #1">11</a>&nbsp;  These conditions include webbed penis, concealed penis, and trapped  penis, in which the penis is normal in size but partially or fully obscured by  the overlay of adjacent adipose or skin tissue.&nbsp;  In contrast, micropenis is the only condition within the rubric of  inconspicuous penile disorders in which the penis is abnormally small.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>While  the ensuing section will focus on the phenomenology of concealed penis, it  remains important to define the other entities in this family of disorders as a  point of contradistinction.&nbsp; Webbed penis  describes a condition, much as the name implies, in which the scrotal skin  extends to form a web or flap of tissue on the ventrum of the penile shaft.&nbsp; On the contrary, trapped penis is an  iatrogenic form of inconspicuous penis in which the phallus has become embedded  in the suprapubic fat pad following circumcision.&nbsp; This presentation can occur following  neonatal circumcision in the setting of significant scrotal enlargement (such  as that from a hydrocele or hernia), after the circumcision of a child with a  webbed penis, or in any other case where the phallus naturally retracts into  the scrotum.&nbsp; Among these boys, if a  circumcision is performed, the skin at the base of the shaft can form a  cicatrix over the retracted phallus postoperatively.&nbsp; This group of patients may in turn be managed  with a combination of topical steroid therapy, dilation of the cicatrix with a  hemostat, or, in infants over 6 months of age, surgery similar to that which  will be described for concealed penis cases.<a href="#_ENREF_12" title="Palmer, 2005 #10">12</a>&nbsp;  Lastly, micropenis refers to cases in which the penis size is 2.5  standard deviations below the mean size for a given age group.<a href="#_ENREF_13" title="Aaronson, 1994 #12">13</a> </p>
  <p><strong>Concealed (Buried/Trapped) Penis</strong></p>
  <p>Concealed  penis encompasses both congenital and acquired conditions whereby the phallus  is retracted inward beneath the suprapubic fat pad and partially obscured by  preputial skin.<a href="#_ENREF_14" title="Maizels, 1986 #11">14</a>&nbsp;  The congenital etiology of concealed penis is thought to result from (1)  poor elasticity of dartos fascia, restricting its ability to move freely  through deep layers of tissue, and (2) the lack of anchoring of the penile skin  to deep fascia, which in turn limits extension.<a href="#_ENREF_15" title="Wein, 2007 #14">15</a>&nbsp;  In older or obese children, anatomical factors such as a pronounced  suprapubic fat pad or a large pannus may contribute to the aforementioned  congenital anomalies to effectively obscure the phallus.&nbsp; Moreover, an unsuccessful circumcision may  also serve to exacerbate this condition by causing penile entrapment or by  allowing the concealed penis to recede further beneath surrounding tissue. </p>
  <p>Patients  with concealed penis usually present to a surgeon due to poor cosmesis or  difficulty maintaining proper hygiene.&nbsp;  In some cases, patients are prompted to seek further evaluation as a  result of symptoms, including recurrent balanitis or spraying of the urinary  stream, caused by ballooning of the foreskin with voiding.&nbsp; Last, patients may be referred with the  erroneous request for a redo circumcision.&nbsp;  On physical exam, a normal penile shaft should be palpable although the  glans and shaft are not visualized above the skin level.&nbsp; If the phallus can be exposed simply by  retracting the overlying skin, a repair is indicated at the surgeon&rsquo;s  discretion.</p>
  <p>Historically,  several techniques have been described to exhume a concealed penis.<a href="#_ENREF_14" title="Maizels, 1986 #11">14</a>,<a href="#_ENREF_16" title="Casale, 1999 #16">16-21</a> &nbsp;  The fundamental aspects of repair involve removal of fibrotic bands on  the dorsum of the penis, and unraveling the prepuce tissue to provide ventral  shaft coverage.&nbsp; In order to help fixate  the skin layer proximal to the phallus, the subcutaneous tissue on the dorsum  of the penis should be tacked to the pubic fascia, and ventrally the scrotal  subcutaneous tissue fixed to the base of the shaft.&nbsp; One technique describes a vertical incision  of the median raphe, followed by complete penile degloving and fixation of the  shaft base to prepubic fascia.<a href="#_ENREF_20" title="Perger, 2009 #50">20</a>,<a href="#_ENREF_22" title="Borsellino, 2007 #89">22</a> &nbsp;  The shaft skin is then affixed to the base of the penis with vertical  mattress sutures.&nbsp; This technique avoids  circumferential incision of the base of the penis and thereby reduces the  incidence of postoperative lymphedema.&nbsp;  In some cases, however, Z-plasty at the level of the penoscrotal  junction or lateral penile shaft may be required to reconstitute an adequate  skin flap.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Penile Torsion</strong></p>
  <p>Congenital  penile torsion is a rotational defect of the penile shaft; it is a common  anomaly, for which the exact incidence remains unknown.&nbsp; In children, the shaft is almost always  rotated in the counterclockwise direction, and this condition may be associated  with other congenital abnormalities such as hypospadias or dorsal hooding with  no urethral defect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the  developmental etiology for torsion is indeterminate, skin tethering and  corporal disproportion, along with abnormal dartos fascial development have  been named as possible contributing factors.&nbsp;  The parents of affected children seek medical attention, usually after a  circumcision is performed or the foreskin is retracted, because of concern  about the cosmetic appearance and/ or future dysfunction.&nbsp; In fact, however, the defect has no  physiologic of functional significance if the rotation is less than 60 to 90  degrees from the midline.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In  most cases the median raphe spirals around the shaft, and, although the glans  may be directed away from midline, the orientation of the erectile tissue is  normal at the base of the shaft.&nbsp; In  cases where there is no evidence of torsion or <a name="_GoBack"></a>chordee related  to corporal disproportion, the repair involves degloving the penis to realign  the overlying skin and restore the raphe to the midline position; several  techniques have been described in this regard.&nbsp;  One approach, deemed the &ldquo;dorsal dartos flap&rdquo; repair, involves creating  a forked or V-shaped flap of tissue with the dorsal aspect of the degloved  shaft skin.&nbsp; One flap can then be brought  around to the ventrum of the penile shaft at the appropriate length as a fulcrum  to oppose the degree of torsion.<a href="#_ENREF_23" title="Bauer, 2009 #135">23</a>,<a href="#_ENREF_24" title="Fisher, 2004 #145">24</a> &nbsp;  Following degloving, another technique involves circumferentially  realigning the tissue starting at the 12 o&rsquo;clock position and moving laterally  in a manner that counterbalances the torsion.&nbsp;  The ventral flap of tissue that remains after the tissue has been  realigned superolaterally, may then be excised.<a href="#_ENREF_25" title="Bar-Yosef, 2007 #146">25</a>&nbsp;  In cases where skin realignment is not sufficient, however, such as in  the setting of torsion exceeding 90 degrees, the base of the penis must also be  mobilized to remove dysgenic bands of tissue; maneuvers involving corporal  plication and/ or suturing the tunica albuginea to the periosteum of the pubis  may also be required.<a href="#_ENREF_19" title="Elder, 2001 #48">19</a>,<a href="#_ENREF_26" title="Rolle, 2005 #150">26</a>,<a href="#_ENREF_27" title="Snow, 2009 #151">27</a> </p>
  <p><strong>Circumcision</strong></p>
  <p>Circumcision&mdash;the  surgical removal of preputial tissue&mdash;has been performed for thousands of years  for a wide array of cultural, religious, and medical indications.<a href="#_ENREF_28" title="Alanis, 2004 #154">28</a>&nbsp;  Presently, common indications for circumcision include recurrent urinary  tract infections and phimosis refractory to the conservative options discussed  above.&nbsp; In addition, there are ancillary  benefits to circumcision in the reduction of the risk of sexually transmitted  infections and a reduced incidence of penile cancer (detailed below). &nbsp;However, the great majority of circumcisions  are performed electively, for cosmesis or cultural reasons, and without urgent  medical indication.<br>

  <h2 align="left">Common Indications and Observed Benefits </h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="left"><em>Recurrent Urinary  Tract Infection</em></h2>
  <p>Male  infants suffer from urinary tract infections more than females, and in a study  by Ginsberg and McKracken, 95% of male patients with urinary tract infections  in the first 3 months of life were uncircumcised.<a href="#_ENREF_29" title="Ginsburg, 1982 #163">29</a>&nbsp;  Meta-analysis data investigating the impact of circumcision on the  incidence of primary and recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) indicated  circumcision reduced the risk of the development of UTI as compared to uncircumcised  counterparts (OR = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.20; p&lt;0.001).&nbsp; Nevertheless, among asymptomatic patients  with no prior history of UTI, infection was rare enough that the complication  rate of circumcision (conservatively estimated at 2.0%) outweighed the risk  reduction seen in treated patients; routine circumcision for prophylaxis  against a first UTI is hence not substantiated by the data.&nbsp; The protective effect of circumcision among  patients with a history of symptomatic UTI, however, supports prophylactic  circumcision among patients with symptomatic UTI in order to reduce the  incidence of recurrent infection.&nbsp; In  fact, the recurrence rate of UTI among all patients, estimated at 10%, reduced  to 1.3% with circumcision, and an even greater benefit was seen among patients  with high-grade vesicoureteral reflux who developed UTI.<a href="#_ENREF_8" title="Singh-Grewal, 2005 #165">8</a>&nbsp;  The mechanism of the protective effect of circumcision on is thought to  be related to a change in bacterial colonization and the behavior of  pathogens.&nbsp; Circumcision has been shown  to greatly reduce colonization with uropathogenic organisms,<a href="#_ENREF_30" title="Wijesinha, 1998 #166">30</a> as Fussell and colleagues reported  that uropathogenic strains of bacteria adhered to the inner mucosal tissue of  the prepuce but not the keratinized, outer epithelial surface.<a href="#_ENREF_31" title="Fussell, 1988 #168">31</a> </p>
  <h3 align="left">Lichen Sclerosus et Atrophicus  (Balanitis Xerotica Obliterans)</h3>
  <p>Lichen  sclerosus et atrophicus refers to a condition traditionally known as balanitis  xerotica obliterans, a chronic inflammatory process yielding edema and  hyperkeratosis of affected tissue.&nbsp;  Lichen sclerosus can lead to meatal stenosis in circumcised and  uncircumcised patients.&nbsp; In uncircumcised  patients, the lesion can be initially confined to the prepuce but may  ultimately progress to involve adjacent tissues and cause stenosis or  stricture.&nbsp; In such cases of chronic  inflammatory lichen sclerosus confined to the prepuce of an uncircumcised  patient, circumcision can be performed therapeutically.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Penile Cancer</h3>
  <p>While  incidence remains low in the United States, penile cancer represents nearly 20%  of male cancers in Africa and Southeast Asia.&nbsp;  The foreskin is a major site of penile intraepithelial neoplasia and  penile cancer; its removal therefore removes a locus for malignant  transformation.&nbsp; Furthermore, phimosis is  a risk factor for the development of penile cancer, and therefore circumcision  is of great protective benefit to patients with respect to this predisposing  factor.&nbsp; Schoen and colleagues studied a  population-based sample and found that, of 89 patients with invasive penile  cancer, 87 were uncircumcised, further supporting the protective nature of  circumcision.<a href="#_ENREF_32" title="Schoen, 2000 #169">32</a>&nbsp;  In addition to the prophylactic benefit of circumcision, the procedure  can be performed with curative intent in cases of penile squamous cell carcinoma  in which the lesion is confined to the prepuce.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Human Papillomavirus</h3>
  <p>Especially  among men with multiple sexual partners, circumcision reduces the risk of both  oncogenic and non-oncogenic strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the  patient and a reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer in their sexual  partners.<a href="#_ENREF_33" title="Castellsague, 2002 #175">33</a>&nbsp;  As HPV infection is thought to be responsible for a great proportion of  cervical, vaginal, penile and anal cancers, the impact of circumcision on this  area of public health is significant.</p>
  <h3 align="left">HIV Transmission</h3>
  <p>Circumcision  as a means of reducing the risk of HIV infection was first suggested by Alcena  and Fink in 1986.<a href="#_ENREF_34" title="Fink, 1986 #178">34</a>&nbsp;  Since that time, many observational studies have reported that  circumcision reduced the risk of infection across all populations, especially  populations exhibiting high-risk behavior.&nbsp;  Since 2005, three large randomized trials have been published that  support these observations.&nbsp; A  randomized, controlled trial by Auvert and colleagues in South Africa enrolled  3,274 men to either circumcision or observation.&nbsp; Over the course of a mean follow-up of 18.1  months, the authors observed an HIV incidence rate of 0.85 cases per 100  person-years among the intervention group and 2.1 cases per 100 person-years  among controls, corresponding to a risk reduction of 60%.<a href="#_ENREF_35" title="Auvert, 2005 #180">35</a>&nbsp;  Bailey and colleagues enrolled 2,784 men in Kenya and, after an average  follow-up of 24 months, found an incidence of 2.1% among the intervention group  and 4.2% among controls; once corrected for participants seropositive at  enrollment and non-adherence to intervention, the authors found a 60% reduction  in HIV incidence with circumcision.<a href="#_ENREF_36" title="Bailey, 2007 #186">36</a>&nbsp;  Both trials were halted based on the findings at interim analysis.&nbsp; In 2007 Gray and colleagues reported the  results of a trial in which 4,996 men in Uganda were randomized to circumcision  or control.<a href="#_ENREF_37" title="Gray, 2007 #190">37</a>&nbsp;  Following 24 months of follow-up, modified intention-to-treat analysis  revealed an incidence of 0.66 cases per 100 person-years among the intervention  group and 1.33 cases per 100 person years among controls, corresponding to a  51% rate reduction. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the  reduction in disease transmission among circumcised patients.&nbsp; One explanation is that the less keratinized  tissue of the uncircumcised penis is vulnerable to microabrasions that disrupt  the epithelium and enable the entry or adherence of pathogens.&nbsp; Ulcerative disease seen secondary to  collections within the preputial sac would also predispose to further  disease.&nbsp; In addition, cellular factors  have been proposed.&nbsp; The inner mucosal  layer of the prepuce is rich in Langerhans cells, which densely express CCR5  and CXCR4 receptors that facilitate HIV entry, and therefore reduction in the  area of tissue expressing these receptors is thought to reduce viral entry and  subsequent infection.</p>
  <p><u>Procedure</u><br>
    The  outer portion of the prepuce, acting as a sheath around the glans, consists  generally of a keratinized epithelium.&nbsp;  The inner mucosal tissue that lines the sheath and lies in contact with  the glans contains a large population of Langerhans cells.<a href="#_ENREF_38" title="Hussain, 1995 #194">38</a>&nbsp;  Variations in the histology of different portions of the prepuce has  been posited as the source of reduced UTI and sexually transmitted infections  seen among circumcised patients.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In  neonatal and younger patients, several devices are often used to facilitate the  procedure.&nbsp; Among these, three are common:  the Gomco clamp, the Mogen shield, and the Plastibell.&nbsp; The Gomco and Mogen devices facilitate sustained  crush injury of the prepuce, followed by excision of the prepuce.&nbsp; Use of the Plastibell device involves placing  a ligature between the device and the tissue, inducing tissue necrosis and  eventual sloughing of the skin and device.&nbsp;  The Mogen shield is often preferred for the relative simplicity of the  device, shorter procedure length, and less operative pain.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In  adults and older children, a sleeve circumcision is often preferred.&nbsp; With the foreskin retracted, an initial  circumferential incision is marked and made just proximal to the coronal  margin, leaving a small cuff of tissue proximal to the corona.&nbsp; The incision is made through the dartos  fascia to the superficial Buck&rsquo;s fascia.&nbsp;  The foreskin is allowed to return to its anatomical position, and a  second circumferential incision is marked at the coronal margin.&nbsp; The resulting sleeve of tissue between these  incisions is removed, and following hemostasis the skin edges are  reapproximated.&nbsp; Given the large size of  vessels in patients of this age, bipolar cautery is often used for hemostasis  rather than the compression of circumcision clamps used in neonates.</p>
  <p><u>Complications  and Contraindications</u><br>
    In  the hospital setting, the perioperative complication rate of circumcision is  reportedly as low as 0.2%, with the most common complications being minor  bleeding and local infection.<a href="#_ENREF_39" title="Wiswell, 1989 #199">39</a>&nbsp;  Serious complications are exceedingly rare.&nbsp; However, removal of an insufficient portion  of foreskin or improper reapproximation can result in phimosis and associated  problems.&nbsp; Contraindications to  circumcision include prematurity, a bleeding disorder, ambiguous genitalia,  hypospadias or other conditions whose correction might require foreskin tissue  as part of a repair of reconstruction.</p>
  <p><u>Anesthesia  in Infant Patients</u><br>
    Attitudes  towards analgesia and anesthesia during circumcision have changed dramatically  in the last several decades.&nbsp; Prior to  this change several reasons existed for the avoidance of this intervention &ndash;  from poor familiarity with anesthetic techniques in this age group to the idea  that intervention would itself be more painful than the result of such a minor  procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further understanding of the  physiological responses attributable to pain have shown that the procedure is  in fact painful and has also enabled the measurement of various interventions  to determine relative efficacy at minimizing pain.&nbsp; In neonatal patients, a multimodal approach  might include a sucrose pacifier, low room lighting, and pharmacologic  anesthetic intervention to minimize patient discomfort.&nbsp; Pharmacologic methods include topical  lidocaine/prilocaine preparations, dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB), and ring  block, as well as acetaminophen for postoperative pain control.&nbsp; DPNB is administered via two injections at  the 10 and 2 o&rsquo;clock positions on the shaft of the penis to anesthetize the  dorsal nerve.&nbsp; Ring block involves  circumferential subcutaneous injections around the mid-shaft.&nbsp; Regardless of method, appropriate attention  should be given to anesthesia and analgesia as standard of care for all  patients undergoing circumcision.<br>
