  <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p>Prune Belly syndrome consists of a constellation of  congenital malformations, with the three major abnormalities being laxity of  the abdominal wall, bilateral undescended testes and abnormalities of the  genitourinary tract. While the unusual &ldquo;prune-like&rdquo; appearance of the abdomen  (Figure 1) is the hallmark that usually identifies these patients, their  underlying renal function is the most important factor in determining their  overall survival. Urinary abnormalities that have been associated with prune  belly syndrome include hydronephrosis, tortuous dilated ureters, variable  degrees of renal dysplasia and an enlarged bladder. The respiratory, musculoskeletal,  gastrointestinal, orthopedic and cardiac systems may also be involved. There  seems to be a broad spectrum of severity within this syndrome as some children  with severe pulmonary and kidney disturbances will not survive the neonatal  period, while others with minimal involvement will only be modestly affected. </p>
  <p>The abdominal wall defect was first described by Fr&ouml;lich  in 1839 and later was graphically recorded by Platt.1  Parker was the first to report a male infant with all three classic components  of the prune belly syndrome.2  Osler in 1901 was the first to utilize the name &ldquo;prune belly&rdquo; and recognized  the distended bladder associated with this syndrome.1,3&nbsp; While, the title &ldquo;prune belly syndrome&rdquo; has  persisted throughout the years, others have found this designation distasteful  and utilized names such as the &ldquo;triad syndrome,&rdquo; &ldquo;mesenchymal dysplasia&rdquo; and  the &ldquo;Eagle-Barrett syndrome.&rdquo;4-6 </p>
  <p>Prune belly syndrome affects between 1 in 30,000 to 1 in  50,000 births, with 95% occurring in male infants.7-9 A recent Kids&rsquo; Inpatient  Database review revealed 133 newborn male infants with PBS of 1 420 991 births,  with an incidence estimate of 3.8 cases/100 000 live births.10  Involved females present with absent abdominal musculature as well as  abnormalities of the genital and urinary systems.11  There also appears to be a higher incidence in twin pregnancies as well as  children born to younger mothers.8 <br>

  <h1>GENETICS</h1>
  <p>No clear genetic pattern for prune belly syndrome exists,  although there is a hypothesized familial inheritance pattern in some isolated  cases. Prune belly syndrome been reported to occur in twins, cousins and both  male and female siblings, suggesting a familial inheritance.12-23 Ramasamy et al reviewed  the majority of these familial cases in 2004.12  They surmised that there may be a sex influenced, autosomal recessive  inheritance pattern that may account for these isolated reports.&nbsp; As diseases inherited in an autosomal  recessive pattern appear to occur at a higher frequency in consanguineous  marriages, additional evidence for this inheritance pattern is suggested by  reports by Frydman and Adeyokunnu.13,24 Frydman reported a case of  prune belly syndrome in a male born to a couple in a consanguineous  relationship; while Adeyokunnu reported a higher incidence of this syndrome in  Nigeria, an area with known greater rates of consanguinity.13,24 Riccardi and Grum have  also suggested a two-step autosomal dominant mutation with sex-limited  expression that may account for the male predominance of this syndrome, as well  as the infrequent number of affected family members.18  While these reports make an argument for a familial inheritance pattern, the  majority of the cases appear to occur in a sporadic nature. Ives et al in their  review of children affected with prune belly syndrome noted eleven pairs of  twins discordant for the syndrome which speaks against an entirely genetic  basis accounting for this syndrome&rsquo;s occurrence.5 </p>
  <p>In addition, specific chromosomal abnormalities are also  rare. Prune belly syndrome has been associated with trisomy 13, trisomy 18,  trisomy 21 and Turner&rsquo;s syndrome, but a specific relationship has not been  demonstrated.25-27 Translocations and  pericentric inversions of chromosome 9 have also been reported in fetuses that  exhibit this syndrome. However, these chromosomal findings are non-specific, as  not all children with this syndrome have these chromosomal abnormalities, nor  do all children with pericentric inversions of chromosome 9 exhibit the prune  belly syndrome.28 </p>
  <p>Associations between posterior urethral valves, Perlman  syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the VACTERL association and the  megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome have been reported.29-32 These associations suggest  a common pathogenesis between prune belly syndrome and these other conditions. </p>
  <h1>EMBRYOLOGY</h1>
  <p>There are three major theories that exist to explain the  prune belly syndrome: fetal outlet obstruction, mesodermal arrest and the yolk  sac theory.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fetal  Outlet Obstruction</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;  In 1903, Stumme suggested that the prune belly syndrome occurred secondary  to bladder outlet obstruction.33&nbsp; He surmised that this infra-vesical obstruction  resulted in the bladder distension, urethral dilation and hydronephrosis  characteristic of this syndrome. Dilation of the bladder was also felt to  result in atrophy of the abdominal wall through venous infarction and also  obstruct the normal dissent of the testicles.34&nbsp; This theory was later substantiated by  Gonzalez et al who recreated the phenotypic findings found in prune belly  syndrome by obstructing the fetal lamb urethra at 43-45 days gestation.35  If infra-vesical obstruction were to result in the findings associated with the  prune belly syndrome, it would appear that the timing and severity of this  obstruction must be critical since the associated findings of this syndrome are  distinct from other obstructive uropathies. Based on the development timeline  of the fetus, it would seem that the obstruction would need to occur between  the 13th and 15th weeks of gestation. Obstruction at this time could account  for the abnormalities found in the prune belly syndrome since by this time the  urachus has begun to close, significant fetal urine production has occurred and  prostatic development is also just beginning.9 </p>
  <p>In humans, urethral obstruction is actually only  identified in about 10-20% of cases.36  Some have postulated that the obstruction may be transient, while others have  speculated that those with obstructive lesions may only represent the most  severe form of the prune belly syndrome. Most of these infants that actually  demonstrate urethral obstruction are from autopsy studies, therefore some feel  that the urethral obstruction model may actually account for &ldquo;the lethal  variant&rdquo; and may not account for children that survive.37  To counteract this argument, some have surmised that the hypoplastic prostatic  urethra could actually function as an obstructing flap valve. In an autopsy  series, Moerman et al found that the prostates of prune belly children were  devoid of smooth muscle fibers and that tuboalveolar glands were reduced in  number.38  They postulated that these hypoplastic prostates resulted in weakness of the  prostatic walls and sacculation of the prostatic urethra. They noted this  bulging was most marked along the dorsal and caudal aspects and felt that this  resulted in the membranous urethra inserting more dorsally, in an oblique  manner, into the prostatic urethra. It was felt that this abnormal insertion  into the hypoplastic prostatic urethra could result in a flap valve mechanism,  causing a functional obstruction. In this fashion, prostatic hypoplasia could  be the cause and not necessarily the effect of the prune belly syndrome. Others  have hypothesized that delayed canalization of the distal urethra could be the  cause of obstruction.39  This delay could account for the inability to identify a true obstruction at  the time of birth, as well as the development of the megalourethra that may  occur in this syndrome. </p>
  <p>The obstructive theory contends that the abdominal wall  findings are secondary to pressure effects of the bladder on the developing  abdominal muscles. Supporting this theory, the muscles directly over the  bladder seem to be the ones that are most severely affected. In addition,  Moerman et al also identified dystrophic muscle changes upon histologic  analysis in their autopsy study.38  They felt that that these histologic findings could be compatible with Pinto&rsquo;s  description of muscular venous infarction, which he felt, was secondary to  pressure from the distended urinary bladder. However, other histologic and  electron microscopy studies of the abdominal wall are more consistent with  developmental arrest, rather that atrophy, and fail to support outlet  obstruction as the cause of the abdominal wall abnormalities.40,41 </p>
  <p>While fetal infra-vesical obstruction seems plausible, it  fails to account for all of the findings associated with prune belly syndrome.  Certainly there are inconsistencies with this theory and not all factors common  in prune belly children can be explained by this model. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Theory  of Mesodermal Arrest</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This  theory suggests that the etiology of the prune belly syndrome is secondary to a  noxious insult to the embryonic mesoderm. During normal fetal development, the  mesoderm flows out between the ectoderm and endoderm. The mesoderm then divides  into segments medially and laterally, which form the somites and the lateral  plate, respectively. The lateral plate then further splits into a visceral and  somatic layer. The somatic layer between the somites and the lateral plate  forms the nephrogenic mesoderm, which is the precursor of the mesonephros,  wolffian duct and metanephros. The somatic layer of the lateral plate mesoderm  is the source of abdominal wall musculature, while the visceral layer of the  lateral plate mesoderm gives rise to the smooth muscle of the urinary and  gastrointestinal tracts.9&nbsp; Many believe that abnormalities of the  mesoderm could account for the syndrome&rsquo;s abdominal wall and genitourinary  findings. </p>
  <p>Stephens and Gupta proposed that abnormalities of the  urinary tract could be explained by abnormal development of the mesonephros  between the 6th and 10th weeks. Normally, the Wolffian  duct, which is a derivative of the mesoderm, terminates caudally into the  urogenital sinus and becomes incorporated into the future membranous urethra  and demarcates the verumontanum. The wolffian ducts and ureteric buds are  further incorporated into the trigone, with the ureteric buds growing into the  nephrogenic blastema. Abnormal incorporation of the terminal wolffian ducts  could produce prostatic hypoplasia, dilation of the prostatic urethra and even  valve-like obstructions. In addition, involvement of the ureteric buds could  lead to abnormal ureteral development and even dysplastic renal development if  the interaction with the nephrogenic blastema is abnormal.42  Simultaneous failure of the somatic layer of the lateral plate mesoderm could  then account for the abdominal wall defects. </p>
  <p>Ives proposed that the mesodermal defect could occur as  early as the 3rd week of gestation. She felt that at the division of  the embryonic disc, which normally occurs at the 3rd week, could  account for the discordant occurrence seen with monozygotic twins.5  Others postulate that the mesodermal abnormalities could also account for  difficulties in testicular descent. They feel that abnormalities in the  testicular gubernaculums, also derivatives of the mesoderm, could result in  unresponsiveness of these tissues to hormonal influences and thus not allow the  testes to descend normally.43-46 </p>
  <p>However, even the mesodermal arrest theory fails to  explain all of the factors associated with the prune belly syndrome. Further  evidence and explanation is necessary to fully support this theory as the cause  of this syndrome.</p>
  <p><strong><em>The  Yolk Sac Theory</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Stephens  has proposed an additional theory to explain the features associated with the  prune belly syndrome. He hypothesizes that in children with prune belly  syndrome, the bladder and posterior urethra are derived from a larger portion  of the allantois than is normally accepted and that an abnormal amount of the  yolk sac is retained as well. This abnormal amount of yolk sac could affect the  abdominal wall development and result in the &ldquo;prune-like&rdquo; appearance. In  addition, the allantoic diverticulum, may be incorporated into the urinary  tract and account for the enlarged urachus, bladder and prostatic urethra  apparent in the prune belly syndrome.42&nbsp; However, this theory fails to account for all  of the abnormalities seen in the renal and genital tract.</p>
  <p><strong>CLINICAL FEATURES</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Genitourinary  Abnormalities</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Kidneys</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;  There  is a wide variation in renal presentation, ranging from normal to severely  dysplastic, nonfunctional kidneys.47&nbsp; It is the degree of renal dysplasia and the  child&rsquo;s overall renal function that usually determines their prognosis. These  renal issues and its resultant pulmonary hypoplasia account for a 20% chance of  stillbirth or death in the neonatal period, with an additional 30% progressing  to renal failure in the first two years of life.33,48&nbsp; Histologically, the most dysplastic kidneys  are similar to those described by Potter demonstrating few nephrons and other  disorganized features.9 </p>
  <p>Hydronephrosis is also a common finding (Figure 2A, B)  and currently is usually detected on prenatal ultrasounds.49  One must remember that the degree of hydronephrosis does not necessarily  correlate with renal function, the degree of ureteral dilation or the abdominal  wall laxity.50  In addition, it is not unusual to identify asymmetric renal involvement, with  one kidney demonstrating severe hydronephrosis and/or dysplasia as compared to  the normal contralateral side.51&nbsp; Ureteropelvic junction obstruction has also  been reported, however non-obstructive hydronephrosis is the general rule.52  In those patients with preserved renal function, it appears that urinary tract  infections may pose the greatest risk to damaging their kidneys.53 </p>
  <p><strong>Ureters</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ureters are elongated, dilated and  tortuous (Figure 3), with the lower one third being more profoundly affected as  compared to the proximal portion.33  Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in up to 75% of patients and the ureteric orifices  may be wide and patulous.9&nbsp; Fluoroscopic images of the ureters may  demonstrate ineffective peristalsis, however typically they are unobstructed  and drain adequately.33  Although rare, there are reports of obstruction at both the ureteropelvic  junction and ureterovesical junction.38,43,54 </p>
  <p>Histologic examination of the ureters reveals  alterations in the ureteral wall architecture. Hypertrophy and smooth muscle  hyperplasia, which may be seen in patients with posterior urethral valves and  vesicoureteral reflux, is typically absent in the prune belly syndrome.  Instead, smooth muscle is sparse or even absent and may be replaced with  cellular fibrous tissue.4,38 There also appears to be an increase in the ratio of collagen to smooth  muscle in the ureteric muscular layer, especially if vesico-ureteral reflux is  present.55 Although present throughout the ureter, the proximal portion of the  ureter appears to have more smooth muscle cells as compared to the distal  portion.4,56 There also appears to be a decrease in the number of nerve plexuses and  Schwann fibers within the ureter as well. These histologic features may  interfere with cell-to-cell impulse propagation and result in poor ureteral  peristalsis. These features should also be taken into consideration if ureteral  surgery is undertaken in these patients.</p>
  <p><strong>Bladder&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The bladder in patients with the prune  belly syndrome is typically enlarged and thickened (Figure 4), but  trabeculations are usually absent.9  This is in sharp contrast to the bladder of a patient with posterior urethral  valves, which is usually markedly trabeculated. During a cystogram, the bladder  therefore is typically smooth walled and may demonstrate an urachal remnant or  diverticulum. Urachal remnants may attenuate the bladder to the abdominal wall.  Urachal cysts or a fully patent urachus are present in 25-50% of the cases.36,42,43 The trigone is typically  enlarged with laterally placed, patulous ureteral orifices, which accounts for  the common association with vesicoureteral reflux.9&nbsp; The trigone also typically funnels into a  poorly defined, wide open bladder neck.39 </p>
  <p>Histologically, the bladder appears to demonstrate two  patterns in patients with prune belly syndrome. In patients with definite lower  urinary tract obstruction the thickened bladders demonstrate an increased muscle  quantity and a normal collagen to muscle ratio. Bladders without obstruction  demonstrate a thinner bladder wall with an increase in the collagen to muscle  ratio.57  The bladder innervation though appears to be normal with a normal distribution  of ganglion cells.4 </p>
  <p>Urodynamic evaluation of the prune belly bladder  typically reveals a large capacity bladder with normal resting pressures.4  These patients usually also demonstrate a delayed first sensation of fullness  with poor bladder contractility.58,59 Bladder instability with  uninhibited detrusor contractions may occur, but usually are rare.58-60 Kinahan et al reported in  their series that 44% of their patients were able to void spontaneously, with  normal voiding pressures and low residual volumes; while the others required  clean intermittent catheterization.59&nbsp; Certainly this poor contractility as well as  the massive vesicoureteral reflux seen in these patients would account for the  high levels of residual urine that may be seen in these individuals. </p>
  <p><strong>Prostate and  Posterior Urethra&nbsp; </strong>The prostatic urethra is  typically elongated and tapers at the membranous urethra (Figure 5). In  addition the bladder neck is usually widely patent and dilated. These  characteristics give the prostatic urethra a typical &ldquo;triangular shape&rdquo; on  radiographs.33&nbsp; The anterior prostatic wall is typically shorter  than the posterior wall. The verumontanum is usually small or absent and a  utricular diverticulum may be present.33&nbsp; A true obstruction at the level of the  prostatic or membranous urethra is rare, only occurring in 10-20% of cases.33  As discussed earlier, these patients who demonstrate true urethral obstructions  are generally considered to be the most severe form of prune belly syndrome.  Without a true urethral obstruction, Stephens has postulated that there may be  kinking of the prostatic urethra secondary to the differences in length between  the anterior and posterior prostate. This kinking may then account for a  functional obstruction by creating a flap valve of the urethra.42 </p>
  <p>Histologic analysis of the prostate in prune belly  patients has revealed severe hypoplasia, with minimal smooth muscle and  tubuloalveolar glands.38&nbsp; In comparison, the prostates from patients  with posterior urethral valves revealed a normal amount of smooth muscle and  glandular parenchyma that was compressed but otherwise normal. This lead  Moerman to speculate that the dilated, hypoplastic prostate is the cause,  rather than the effect, of the prune belly syndrome.38 </p>
  <p><strong>Anterior  Urethra</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically the anterior urethra in these  patients is normal, although there have been reports of both urethral atresia  and microurethras, as well as the development of the megalourethra in these  patients. Those patients with either urethral atresia or a microurethra  typically only survive secondary to a patent urachus. Some have suggested that  these narrow urethras are normally developed, but underused and may therefore  be managed with progressive dilation.61 </p>
  <p>The two types of megalourethra, scaphoid and fusiform,  may be associated with this syndrome. In the fusiform variety, the corpora  cavernosa is deficient as well as the spongiosum. This form is more severe and  may be associated with renal dysplasia and other lethal abnormalities.62  Scaphoid megalourethra, which is the more common and less severe form, is  characterized by only a deficiency of the spongiosum, with preservation of the  corpora cavernosa, glans and fossa navicularis.33  It is believed that a mesodermal defect could account for these urethral  maldevelopments.63 </p>
  <p><strong>Accessory  Male Sex Organs</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abnormalities of the vas deferens,  epididymis and seminal vesicles have been noted. Given the common mesodermal  derivation of these organs, these findings are not surprising. The epididymis is  commonly detached from the testes and the vas has been found to drain  ectopically.64  In addition, the seminal vesicles may be dilated or even atretic or absent.42  All of these findings, along with the abnormal testicular histology are  significant in regards to these patients&rsquo; future fertility.</p>
  <p><strong>Testis&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Bilateral cryptorchidism is considered  a hallmark of this syndrome, with the majority of these testes being  intra-abdominal above the level of the iliac vessels.33  The gubernaculums originally were suggested to be normal, although elongated  and attached to the internal inguinal ring; however Elder et al have suggested  that the gubernaculum may actually be abnormal and possibly even absent.4,45 This explanation may also  account for the maldescent of these testes, in addition to the theory of  obstruction from the distended bladder.</p>
  <p>Histologically these testes also demonstrate a variety of  abnormalities. Orvis et al have reported a reduction in the number of  spermatogonia, as well as Leydig cell hyperplasia.65  In addition, Massad et al have demonstrated atypical germ cells with abnormal  nuclei.66  These abnormal germ cells resemble intratubular testicular neoplasms and thus  children with prune belly syndrome must be closely monitored for the  development of testicular tumors. Indeed, there have been documented cases of  testicular tumors developing in these patients, but overall the risk does not  appear to be greater than other patients with undescended testes.67-69<br><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

  <p><strong>Sexual Function and  Fertility</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexual  function in patients with prune belly syndrome appears to be intact. Provided  that the corpora cavernosum are normal, these patients may experience normal  erections and orgasm and may maintain satisfying sexual relationships.70 However, given the open bladder neck, these patients experience  retrograde ejaculation and tend to be azoospermic.70,71&nbsp; There are no reports of fathers  with prune belly syndrome reproducing naturally. To date the only reported case  of paternity in a patient with prune belly syndrome involved intracytoplasmic  sperm injection.72&nbsp; Clearly, the infertility  associated with this syndrome is multifactorial as there are histologic  abnormalities of the testes and prostate, as well as anatomic abnormalities of  the prostate, bladder neck, vas deferens, seminal vesicles and testicles. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Extragenitourinary Abnormalities</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Abdominal  Wall&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The characteristic wrinkled,  &ldquo;prune-like&rdquo; skin of the newborn is one characteristic finding in children with  prune belly syndrome (Figure 1). This appearance is secondary to skeletal  muscle hypoplasia that occurs in all three muscle layers of the abdominal wall.40&nbsp; The upper rectus muscles and outer oblique  muscles are usually better developed and the degree of hypoplasia may be  variable and asymmetric 9,  33.&nbsp; The order of involvement from most to least  involved is: transversus abdominis, rectus abdominis below the umbilicus,  internal oblique, external oblique and rectus abdominis above the umbilicus.6  The more developed upper rectus abdominis muscle results in cephalic  displacement of the umbilicus. Indeed, the diminished muscle mass may allow one  to see the bowel peristalsis through the skin. </p>
  <p>The impaired abdominal wall may hinder a newborn&rsquo;s  ability to sit from the supine position and may delay the child&rsquo;s ability to  walk.33  Otherwise, there appears to be no other hindrance to normal physical  activity.&nbsp; The lack of abdominal muscle  may also result in a poor coughing ability and may contribute to an increased  incidence of respiratory infections.73  Others surmise that the deficient abdominal muscles, may also contribute to  constipation.39  Overall however, it appears that although the abdominal wall laxity may be  visibly profound, the physical limitations from this deficiency are actually  quite minimal.</p>
  <p>Evaluation of the abdominal wall has revealed normal nerve  distribution and blood supply to the muscles.40,74 The muscle fibers occur  haphazardly and in the most severe cases are entirely absent. Microscopically,  the fibers may be replaced by a thick collagenous layer.9&nbsp; In addition, Mininberg et al utilized  electron microscopy to visualize Z-band disorganization and glycogen aggregates.40 </p>
  <p><strong>Orthopedic  Abnormalities&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Orthopedic abnormalities  occur in 45-63% of prune belly patients.75  The most frequent anomalies are hip dislocation and talipes equinovarus.51  More severe deformities such as limb deformities and arthrogryposis appear to  be secondary to oligohydroamnios causing compression of the developing fetus.51,76 In addition pectus  carinatum and pectus excavatum deformities are commonly present, while  scoliosis is the most common spinal abnormality.76,77 Growth has been found to  be impaired in 32% of prune belly patients and has correlated with poor renal  function.78  The growth retardation appears to be most profound in the first year of life,  but catch-up growth appears to remain incomplete throughout life.78 </p>
  <p><strong>Gastrointestinal  Abnormalities&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Gastrointestinal anomalies  appear to occur in up to 30% of affected prune belly children. Abnormalities  such as malrotation, atresia, stenosis and volvulus appear to result secondary  to persistence of the embryonic mesentery.79&nbsp; The same defects in suspension may also allow  the spleen to wander freely and splenic torsion has been reported.80  Gastroschisis, imperforate anus and omphaloceles have all been reported to  occur in prune belly patients.79,81-83&nbsp; Constipation may also occur and may be the  result of absent abdominal muscular tone. In addition, Hirshsprung&rsquo;s disease  has been reported to occur in these patients and may also contribute to the  constipation. Because of these reported gastrointestinal associations, it has  been recommended that all prune belly patients undergo radiographic evaluation  of their GI tract.79 </p>
  <p><strong>Cardiac  Abnormalities&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Cardiac abnormalities have  been reported to occur in 10% of prune belly patients.51  Associated cardiac findings include ventricular and atrial septal defects,  patent ductus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot.51  Given these associations, it is recommended that all prune belly patients  undergo cardiovascular evaluation.</p>
  <p><strong>Pulmonary  Abnormalities&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>As pulmonary development in  utero is dependent on adequate amounts of amniotic fluid, fetuses with renal  failure and severe renal insufficiency may also develop pulmonary hypoplasia.  In the worst cases, severe pulmonary hypoplasia is incompatible with life and  may result in death in the perinatal period.51  It appears that 20% of newborns will die in the perinatal period secondary to  pulmonary issues.71,84 Of those that survive, 55%  of patients will suffer prolonged, significant pulmonary problems.78&nbsp; The lax abdominal wall may impair mechanical  ventilation and can increase the incidence of pneumonia.85,86 These same issues may also  contribute to the development of bronchitis and respiratory compromise that may  occur after anesthesia and respiratory tract infections.78,86 </p>
  <p>There are also a subset of patients with incomplete  features of this syndrome and have been dubbed the &ldquo;pseudoprune&rdquo;. Often these  individuals will not have the characteristic abdominal wall findings, but will  suffer from bilateral cryptorchidism and also demonstrate the associated  urinary tract findings.87  These patients are still at risk for developing renal failure and therefore  must be followed closely.87 </p>
  <p><strong>PBS in Girls&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Five percent of prune belly children  are female. Associated abnormalities in these children include the typical  abdominal wall appearance and urinary tract abnormalities (Figure 6).11  Additional findings in these females included a high rate of vaginal atresia,  uterine duplication and imperforate anus. Reinberg et al, in their series of  females with prune belly syndrome also demonstrated a high rate of renal  hypoplasia and dysplasia, similar to their male counterparts.11  Urethral atresia, uterine duplication, and anorectal anomalies occurred  frequently in these girls. The perinatal mortality rate was high; of the four  surviving patients, renal failure developed in two and renal transplantation  was required.11 </p>
  <p><strong>PRESENTATION  AND EVALUATION</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Prenatal Diagnosis and Intervention</em></strong> </p>
  <p>The diagnosis of prune belly syndrome may be suspected as  early as 11 weeks of gestation via prenatal ultrasound.88  Associated sonographic findings include oligohydroamnios or anhydramnios,  hydroureter, a distended bladder and a thin, attenuated abdominal wall.89  Megacystis megaureter syndrome or posterior urethral valves, may have similar  findings in fetal ultrasonogram. Although modern ultrasonic capabilities and  visualization have improved, it can still be difficult to establish a definite  prenatal diagnosis. Previous reports have shown that prenatal diagnostic  accuracy to ascertain the etiology of hydronephrosis varies between 30-85%.90 </p>
  <p>The identification of the above prenatal findings have  prompted some to either recommend in-utero placement of a vesicoamniotic shunt  in order to decompress the urinary tract and establish a normal amount of  amniotic fluid or suggest termination of pregnancy.91-94 The degree of collecting  system dilatation, however, does not represent the severity of obstruction nor  does it reflect the post-natal renal function. Thus it may be difficult to  justify the&nbsp; need for any intervention or  termination using degree of hydronephrosis alone.95  Criteria used for in-utero shunting include a normal karyotype, severe  oligohydroamnios and normal fetal renal function.94&nbsp; Decision to  intervene is based on serial evaluations of fetal urine chemistries such as  sodium, chloride, osmolarity, microglobulin, and total protein.96 Fetuses with high urine sodium and osmolarity values have  the poorest prognosis.  In the rare instance of&nbsp; progressive  oligohydramnios with urethral atresia97  or potential obstruction during labor due to massively distended bladder  intervention may be beneficial.91  Despite several case reports documenting the ability to perform this procedure,  reviews have failed to demonstrate a sustainable improvement in renal and  pulmonary function.90,98,99&nbsp; In addition, complications of shunt placement  have occurred including traumatic gastroschisis secondary to an abdominal wall  defect from a misplaced shunt.100  Freedman et al also demonstrated a 38% mortality rate and 29% renal failure  rate in children that underwent intrauterine interventions.97&nbsp; It would seem that in-utero intervention has  certain potential, but does not yet achieve the desired renal or pulmonary  improvement benefit. Given these circumstances, fetal intervention requires a  careful risk/benefit assessment and a thorough discussion with the child&rsquo;s  parents. </p>
  <p><strong>Peripartum Care</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the  newborn may require ventillatory support and advanced neonatal care, it is  prudent to have the delivery where neonatal care facilities are available.  Delivery may be complicated by preterm labor, chorioamnionitis or fetal  entrapment due to the enlarged bladder. The associated pulmonary hypoplasia in  infants with prune belly syndrome can lead to pneumothoraces. For neonates who  have pulmonary hypoplasia, advanced support such as high-frequency ventilation  and possibly inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) will be required.101 An experienced obstetric and neonatal team should be  present at delivery. </p>
  <p><strong>Neonatal  Period</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The characteristic prune-like appearance of  the abdomen usually suggests the diagnosis (Figure 1). A multi-disciplinary  approach is required for the initial evaluation, specifically involvement of  the neonatologist, nephrologist and urologist. Involvement of other disciplines  will depend on the clinical profile.&nbsp; If  there is cardiac or pulmonary involvement, evaluation and treatment of these  take precedence during the immediate post natal examination.&nbsp; Genitourinary involvement may be assessed  once the child is stable.</p>
  <p><strong>Evaluation of  Renal Function</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; An initial creatinine serves as a baseline  but the value may be related to maternal creatinine. Serial serum creatinine  measurements are essential to determine the neonatal renal function as well as  to monitor the trend. A rise in creatinine over the first several weeks  portends a poor prognosis. If the creatinine is noted to nadir at less than 0.7  ng/dl, it&nbsp; has been noted that subsequent  renal failure is less likely.102  In addition, serum electrolytes should also be monitored and may be helpful in  assessing overall renal function. </p>
  <p><strong>Imaging</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;Radiographic evaluation of the  newborn should begin with chest radiography.&nbsp;  This will help rule out any associated pulmonary complications as a  result of oligohydramnios which can be seen with PBS, specifically pneumothorax,  pneumomediastinum, and pulmonary hypoplasia.103&nbsp; Renal and bladder ultrasound can  assess parenchyma, the presences of cortical cysts and bladder distension.&nbsp; A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) should be  obtained (Figures 3, 5) in the presence of renal insufficiency104 to differentiate between obstruction and stasis.&nbsp; Ideally, prophylactic antibiotics should be  started before a VCUG is obtained to minimize the risk of infection.&nbsp; In the newborn with normal renal function and  clinical evidence of bladder emptying, a VCUG can be delayed, since nearly 70%  of children have vesicoureteral reflux. 105, 106&nbsp; Nuclear medicine renal scan with  99mTcDMSA or 99mTcMAG3 helps to identify functioning  renal tissue. However, stasis due to ureteral dilation and tortuosity may  preclude any diagnosis of obstruction with lasix washout renography (Figure  7).&nbsp; Renography can be obtained after 4  weeks to allow for changes during neonatal physiology. </p>
  <p><strong>MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Spectrum of PBS</em></strong></p>
  <p>Since there is a wide spectrum of presenting  characteristics in patients with PBS three major categories of presentation in  the neonatal period was described by Woodard.107  Though there is no clear delineation among the categories, this classification  helps planning the evaluation and management of the neonate. </p>
  <p><strong>Category 1</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;The renal dysplasia or urethral obstruction  secondary to atresia results in marked oligohydramnios. This in turn results in  severe pulmonary hypoplasia. A constellation of other system involvement may be  present. The pulmonary hypoplasia or renal failure commonly results in death in  the neonatal period. Since these neonates have other life threatening issues,  only limited urological intervention is indicated, often it is limited to  bladder catheterization.</p>
  <p><strong>Category 2</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;They have varying degree of renal  insufficiency, upper tract dilatation and vesicoureteral reflux. As they seldom  have life threatening early neonatal pulmonary or renal insufficiency, the  evaluation and management of the urinary tract assumes importance. They require  an individualized approach due to varying degrees of presentation. Specific treatment of the dilated urinary tract in this  group has remained controversial for the past 25 years.108, 109 There is an overlap between the  clinical features of Category II and Category III patients and differing proportions  of these are included in reported series. In addition, the long term follow up  is limited. Hence it is difficult to compare the results of various series that  advocate either aggressive surgical management or a conservative approach.  Patients in category 2 require an individualized approach due to varying  degrees of presentation. Since infection and progressive renal insufficiency is  the major cause of morbidity and mortality in this group, aggressive surgical  therapies were performed and as a result, anatomical and functional improvement  was noted.84,108,110&nbsp; Improved renal outcome and decrease in  urinary tract infections was documented with ureteral tailoring, shortening and  reimplantation, thus minimizing stasis and reflux.84,110&nbsp; Others have advocated close observation of  these patients with monitoring for urinary tract infection and surgical  intervention for those with urinary tract obstruction or ongoing bacterial  infection.109  Woodhouse et al, in a series of 47 cases, had 13 neonates who presented with  infection and gross urinary tract dilatation. High diversion was carried out in  twelve. Further upper tract reconstruction was attempted in six of these but  normal micturition and stable renal function were achieved only in three.111  However, due to the wide variation of presenting characteristics in this  patient population and the limited published data, no outright recommendation  can be made regarding patients who fall into this category. The treatment plan  should be tailor made depending upon the co-morbidities, renal function,  infections, overall clinical picture and the preferences of the family.112 </p>
  <p><strong>Category  3&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>This group comprises children with  incomplete or a mild triad of features, mild to moderate uropathy, no renal  dysplasia, stable renal function and no pulmonary hypoplasia.&nbsp; Their renal function is usually preserved.  They require regular monitoring with ultrasound and creatinine. Unless there is  worsening of the renal function or recurrent UTI, they do not require any  surgery of the urinary tract. In the absence of indication for urinary tract  reconstruction, bilateral orchiopexy is carried out in infancy.&nbsp; Any deterioration in renal function or new  urinary tract infection requires further evaluation. Urodynamics may be  required to assess the bladder and adequacy of voiding.58&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><em>Surgical Treatment</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Urinary  Diversion</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Urinary diversion may be required during  initial management, in view of urosepsis, urinary tract obstruction or  worsening renal function. If voiding is inefficient because of urethral  stricture, valves or atresia, urinary diversion will be required. In neonates  with bladder outflow obstruction, the urachus is patent but since it closes in  the first few weeks of life, drainage through urachus is unpredictable. </p>
  <p><strong>Vesicostomy</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; When indicated, cutaneous vesicostomy is a  quick and efficient method to divert the urine at the level of the bladder and  Blocksom&rsquo;s technique is commonly employed. It is important to construct the  stoma using the dome of the bladder. Since the bladder is large and floppy, if  the cystotomy is made lower down in the anterior bladder wall it is prone to  prolapse and obstruction. A larger stoma is recommended in PBS since stomal  stenosis is common.&nbsp; A patent urachus or  a large diverticulum at the urachus are encountered frequently. If present, the  diverticulum or patent urachus may be excised at the time of vesicostomy.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Supravesical  Diversion</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the  majority of cases, vesicostomy is adequate for effective decompression of the  urinary system.&nbsp; In the setting of  massive reflux, a single loop ureterostomy may allow for adequate decompression  of both kidneys while simultaneously allowing for normal bladder cycling.  However, in the setting of obstruction at the ureterovesical or ureteropelvic  junction, proximal urinary diversion is recommended. If&nbsp;  ureterovesical reconstruction is anticipated, it is preferable to avoid  a high loop ureterostomy, since the upper ureter is utilized for the  reconstruction and the vascularity of this segment may be compromised by the  loop ureterostomy.56,113 A low loop ureterostomy may adequately decompress  both the ipsilateral kidney as well as the bladder without endangering later  reconstruction. End cutaneous ureterostomy may be considered if upper ureteric  obstruction is not suspected. In addition to relieving obstruction, the upper  ureteric anatomy is not disturbed and there is a decrease in the caliber of the  severely dilated ureter, which is desirable for future reconstruction.113 Another alternative for upper tract drainage is  cutaneous pyelostomy. Infants requiring temporary diversion requiring a  complete reconstruction planned at a later date may benefit from initial  pyelostomy followed by bilateral tapered ureteroneocystostomy, reduction  cystoplasty, bilateral orchiopexy and abdominoplasty once they are optimized.114 Since &ldquo;total reconstruction&rdquo; however has little role  in the modern management of prune belly syndrome, rarely will pyelostomies be  indicated. Temporary percutaneous nephrostomy drainage is a safer option for  temporary diversion in an infant who is acidotic and septic, unfit for  anesthesia. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Reconstruction</em></strong></p>
  <p>Reconstruction pertinent to urogenital system may be  classified as orchidopexy, abdominoplasty and urinary tract reconstruction.  Undescended testes are a hallmark of Prune Belly Syndrome and there is  universal agreement regarding the need for orchidopexy. The abdominal wall  defect may range from mild divergence of the rectus muscles to severe  deficiency of the abdominal wall and decision for abdominoplasty depends  largely on the extent of deformity and desired cosmesis. Recently, improvement  in&nbsp; bladder emptying is an additional  consideration to offer abdominoplasty in full blown PBS.115  True obstructive uropathy, recurrent urinary tract infections and chronic renal  insufficiency in anticipation of renal replacement therapy are relative  indications for surgical intervention. It is unclear if correction of high  grade reflux and/or restoration of normal caliber and capacity of urinary tract  have any effect on minimizing renal deterioration&nbsp; or reducing the risk for infections and there  is considerable controversy regarding the indications and timing of urinary  tract &nbsp;reconstruction. In order to improve detrusor function,  reduction cystoplasty was suggested116  but it did not seem to decrease bladder capacity or improve voiding dynamics in  the long-term.117  As there are no definite criteria to assign the category and classification and  as the natural history is variable, it is difficult to compare the outcomes of  different series.</p>
  <p><strong>Urethra</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The spectrum of urethral abnormalities  includes urethral atresia or microurethra, megalourethra or obstruction at the  prostato-membranous urethra. Successive urethral dilation as described by  Passerini-Glazel et al using the P.A.D.U.A. technique has been suggested for  urethral atresia but the results have not been uniformly successful.61  If vesicostomy is present, a through and through dilatation may be possible.  Four out of six boys reported by Gonzalez et al required some form of  supravesical diversion after multiple unsuccessful attempts at dilatation.118  Initial perineal flap urethrostomy followed by reconstruction may be required.119 <br>
    As  previously mentioned, megalourethra may be either the fusiform or the scaphoid  type.&nbsp; The scaphoid megalourethra is more  common. The technique was initially described by Nesbit in 1955.After a  circumcising incision and degloving of the penis he performed a longitudinal  reduction urethroplasty is performed over a catheter. This technique is  straightforward, avoids overlapping suture lines, and its principles remain in  wide use today.120&nbsp; An alternate technique is urethral placation,  as described by Heaton and colleagues.121&nbsp; Reconstruction may be technically challenging  in the fusiform variant, since there is no surrounding spongiosum and the  urethra is often massively dilated. The options are limited, due to lack of  periurethral tissue. The phallus is usually greatly enlarged and can be more  capacious than the native bladder. Nevertheless, there have been reports of  phallic reconstruction in these patients with satisfactory cosmetic and  functional outcomes.122  The rarity of the defect precludes any generalizations with regard to surgical  management; each case must be considered individually.120 </p>
  <p>Since the prostatic urethra is hypoplastic,  there is an abrupt change in caliber at the prostatomembranous junction but  true obstruction is rare. Occasionally prostato-membranous urethral  obstruction, classified by Stephens as a type IV valve, is present. It is  caused by redundant tissue in the membranous urethra and can be incised  transurethrally.123 Woodhouse et al followed up 29 patients in Category III who were well  at birth, with stable renal function. When there was upper deterioration, the  obstruction was noted to be generally in the urethra, which was relieved  endoscopically either by resection of a narrow ring or by full length  urethrotomy.111 In children with PBS with high post-void residuals, increasing  hydroureteronephrosis or VUR, internal urethrotomy may be considered though no  long term success has been demonstrated.124</p>
  <p><strong>Bladder</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Urodynamic evaluation of the bladder is  indicated in the setting of urinary tract infections and large residual  volumes.58  Evidence of resistance at the vesicourethral junction has been postulated to  contribute to the large post void residuals along with poor bladder  contractility and high grade vesicoureteral reflux.&nbsp; In children who are unable to maintain low  residual volumes some authors have proposed internal urethrotomy to lower the  sphincter resistance and allow for improved emptying of the bladder. 58,  109&nbsp; Additionally, clean intermittent  catheterizations can facilitate improved bladder emptying.59 </p>
  <p><strong>Reduction Cystoplasty  &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Poor bladder function along with large  capacity and massive vesicoureteral reflux can lead to decreased bladder  emptying.&nbsp; In order to enhance bladder  emptying, Perlmutter initially proposed reduction cystoplasty as a means to  reconstruct the shape of the bladder to a more spherical appearance.116  However the bladder volume returned to baseline or increased when compared to  pre-reduction cystoplasty volumes in long term follow up.117  No difference is noted on urodynamics to patients with reconstruction versus  those without.59  &nbsp;Hence reduction cystoplasty is reserved  for removal of a dilated urachal segment which may be seen with urethral  abnormalities, or to excise a large urachal diverticulum. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Upper Urinary Tract</em></strong><br>
      <strong>Ureteral  Reconstruction</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in  approximately 70% of PBS children. Conservative approach in these patients  consists of antibiotic prophylaxis and serial monitoring of renal function with  goals to maintain renal function and avoiding any ureteral surgery.113  Initial proximal diversion with later reconstruction was noted to yield results  that are equally successful and comparable with primary reconstructive surgery  carried out in early infancy or later childhood.115&nbsp; In the setting of recurrent pyelonephritis or  progressive renal decline, ureteric tailoring, straightening and reimplantation  after excising the redundant dilated lower ureter, is recommended.&nbsp; Ureteral tapering and reimplantation can be  performed using plications or an excisional with equal success.106&nbsp; Submucosal tunneling may be challenging if  plications are performed due to the bulk of the resultant ureter.&nbsp; Occasionally the redundant tortuous distal  ureter can be excised with standard reimplantation of a more normal sized  proximal ureter. </p>
  <p><strong>Orchidopexy</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Undescended testicles are one  of the hallmarks of this syndrome.&nbsp; The  timing of orchidopexy depends on fitness for anesthesia and need for  concomitant abdominoplasty or urinary tract reconstruction. Since the endocrine  function is preserved and there is a malignant potential, earlier orchidopexy  is desirable. Most of these testes are intra-abdominal, high in the posterior  pelvic wall overlying the iliac vessels, and hence spontaneous descent is  unlikely.&nbsp; Standard orchidopexy, without  division of the testicular vessels may be more successful&nbsp; if the orchidopexy is done during early  infancy.125&nbsp; Since the testes are located in  the abdomen at the level of the iliac vessels, adequate proximal mobilization  is difficult with the standard inguinal approach and trans-abdominal approach  is preferred. If concomitant urinary reconstruction or abdominoplasty is being  performed, the vessels can be mobilized till the origin to ensure adequate  mobilization for single stage orchidopexy. The primary objective of orchiopexy  is to preserve the hormonal function and to enable easy examination, since  malignant potential has been documented.66 In addition, though the fertility potential is compromised, assisted  reproductive techniques may be possible. There is a single report of mature  spermatozoa in the post-coital urine in a patient who underwent neonatal  orchidopexy.115 Testosterone levels were found to be higher in boys who underwent  orchidopexy in early infancy compared to those who had staged or  Fowler-Stephens orchidopexy at an older age. Hence orchidopexy as early as six  months has been recommended.115&nbsp; If no additional urological procedure is indicated and  abdominoplasty is not planned, laparoscopic orchidopexy is an option to be  considered. Dissection may be carried out till the origin of the testicular  vessels, thus facilitating single stage orchidopexy. The altered anatomy of  these children presents an unusual landscape to the laparoscopic procedure.  Since the ureter and the kidneys are often grossly dilated, care must be  exercised during dissection.126 Laparoscopic  Fowler-Stephen&rsquo;s technique is executed either as a one stage or staged approach  with reasonable success when a single stage orchidopexy is not possible.126,127 Microvascular autotransplantation is an alternative for high  intra-abdominal testes that cannot be brought down to the scrotum despite  adequate mobilization.128 </p>
  <p><strong>Long-term  Follow-up of Orchidopexy</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Normal erections and orgasm was experienced  by 9 patients between 16 and 28 years of age who underwent orchidopexies in  late childhood or adolescence. Seven of these had retrograde ejaculation. Two  of these were anorchic and of the remaining seven, six had normal testosterone  levels. Though infertile, these men were sexually active.70  Orchidopexy can be performed using either an open or laparoscopic approach if  completed within the first few years of life.&nbsp;  Often, the testicles can be brought down to the scrotum without a  Fowler-Stephen&rsquo;s approach.110  Patil and colleagues reviewed the outcome of orchidopexy in 41 boys 20 underwent bilateral 1-stage orchidopexy, 10 with  unilateral 1-stage and contralateral 2-stage orchidopexy, and 11 underwent.  Except for two who underwent bilateral single stage orchidopexy, others had  satisfactory outcome sufficient to induce puberty and maintain sexual function.  Division of gonadal vessels did not seem to adversely affect the outcome.127 In a series of 32 boys with PBS who underwent bilateral  orchidopexy, 26 did not require ligation of testicular arteries. Unilateral and  bilateral ligation of pedicles was performed in 2 and 4, respectively. Five  testes had atrophied, for which three underwent ligation of the artery.112 </p>
  <p><strong>Abdominal Wall Reconstruction</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to the urinary tract, the spectrum of abdominal  wall defect extends from mild protuberance to severe laxity and bulge. In those  with minimal deficiency, there may be improvement as they grow up and no  intervention may be required. However, most children with PBS of Category II  have significant abdominal wall defect. The abdominal wall defect may not have  life threatening consequences but the inefficient contraction of the abdominal  wall muscles is believed to affect bladder, bowel, and pulmonary function.129  Consequently, abdominal wall repair might improve coughing and defecation,  though there is no evidence for the same.115  If concomitant urinary tract reconstruction is anticipated, it is prudent to  wait till a clear picture of the urinary tract and voiding function is obtained  and the reconstruction is planned. If no urinary tract reconstruction is  anticipated, it may be combined with orchiopexy during infancy. Abdominoplasty  along with orchidopexy at 6 months enables adequate mobilization of the testes.  Since these infants have underlying pulmonary hypoplasia101  and the breathing may be further compromised by abdominoplasty,&nbsp; the benefit in terms of successful  orchidopexy and reconstruction should be weighed against the anesthetic risk,  since mortality due to pulmonary issues have been documented following neonatal  reconstruction.115 <strong> </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Randolph  Technique</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Randolph et al 130  initially described abdominal wall reconstruction based on electromyography data.  EMG mapping indicated that the most severely affected area is the  infraumbilical region. Hence they recommended a transverse incision from the  tip of the 12th rib over the anterior superior iliac spine down to  the pubic symphysis and back up to the contralateral anterior superior iliac  spine and tip of the 12th rib. A parallel incision is made with the  excess skin pulled taut.&nbsp; Full thickness  removal of the skin, underlying muscle and peritoneum was performed.&nbsp; Full thickness reapproximation of the healthy  inferior margin of the fascia, including the periosteum is performed at the  anterior superior iliac spines and pubic symphysis using non-absorbable  suture.&nbsp; The fascia is closed using  interrupted suture followed b skin reapproximation.&nbsp; One series of 16 patients noted in 7 patients  laterally bulging of the abdominal wall.106&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Ehrlich  Technique</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehrlich first described his methodology in  1986 and later modified it in 1993.131,  132 The technique involves a  vertical incision with preservation of the umbilicus.&nbsp; There is extensive mobilization of the  lateral muscular layer from the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue,  followed by a vest over pants closure.&nbsp;  This closure brings the unaffected lateral musculofascial layer into the  midline and allows for removal of excess skin and preservation of the  umbilicus.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Monfort  Technique</strong>&nbsp; The Monfort technique (Figure 8) also  utilizes a vertical incision.133  Using an elliptical incision from the xiphoid to the pubic symphsis and a  second incision around the umbilicus for preservation, the underlying  subcutaneous layers are dissected off the fasica laterally to the anterior axillary  line. A vertical incision is made lateral to the superficial epigastric  arteries.&nbsp; The posterior parietal  peritoneum is incised. The central island muscle flap is secured to the  posterior parietal peritoneum.&nbsp; The  mobilized lateral muscle flaps are brought over the central muscle flap and  reapproximated in midline, similar to a vest over pants technique.&nbsp; This technique increases the anterior  abdominal wall thickness, creates a waistline and reduces any bulge.&nbsp; Other authors have reported satisfactory results  with good patient satisfaction using this technique. 134  Since the periumbilical skin in the midline is not excised in the Montfort  technique, the umbilicus often appears too high after the repair. A  neo-umbilical reconstruction along with Montfort abdominoplasty has been  suggested.135&nbsp; An almond shaped skin island is preserved at  the level of the iliac crest in the midline, attached to the dermis. This is  invaginated by placing absorbable sutures from underneath the fascia. Another  modification to this technique has been described by Furness et al.136  In this approach, the peritoneal cavity is not entered and the abdominal wall  dissection is minimal. If orchidopexy has been performed earlier, this  technique is useful to avoid entry into the peritoneal cavity.</p>
  <p><strong>Firlit  Technique</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; In this technique, the laxity of the  abdominal wall is assessed by grasping the midline with towel clips and lifting  the abdominal wall till it is taut. An elliptical skin incision is then made  around the base of the redundant skin from the xyphoid to the pubis preserving  an island of the umbilical skin. The excess skin is excised and the fascial  plate laxity is corrected with a plicating technique with full thickness  vertical folds. The peritoneal cavity is note entered. Hence this procedure is  an option if no concomitant intraperitoneal procedures are required. Authors  have reported satisfactory outcome in 13 patients who underwent the procedure.136 </p>
  <p><strong>Laparoscopic Assisted Abdominal Wall Reconstruction&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;Laparoscopic-assisted repair has been described to  minimize violation of the peritoneal cavity.137&nbsp; Peritoneal cavity was visualized using a  telescope introduced through a 5 mm sub-xiphoid trocar, while vertical  abdominal wall plication of the fascia was done by Firlit technique.136  In addition to visualization of the viscera when the deep plicating sutures are  taken, the pneumoperitoneum gives the surgeon a  representative idea of what the reconstructed abdomen is going to look like  when the patient is erect, thus enabling optimal abdominal wall reduction. </p>
  <p><strong>Outcome of  Abdominoplasty</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Smith et all evaluated the voiding changes  in twelve patients who underwent Monfort&nbsp;  abdominoplasty. Subjective changes that occurred after abdominoplasty  included resolution of or less double voiding in 9 patients, improved urinary  continence in 7, improved bladder fullness sensation in 11, improved urinary  flow in 10 and improved defecation in 5. They also noted that incidence of  urinary tract infections decreased from a preoperative average of 5.7 per  patient per year to 1.2 per patient per year postoperatively. In addition,  post-void residual volumes significantly decreased from a preoperative average  of 40% of bladder capacity to 13%&nbsp; after  abdominoplasty even in those who did not undergo concomitant urinary  reconstruction&nbsp; suggesting the influence  of abdominoplasty on improved micturition.129  In the series by Denes et al, the flaccidity improved in 29 out of 30 patients  who underwent comprehensive repair. Abdominoplasty improved not only the  corporal image and self-esteem, but also abdominal strength, with good results  in 93.5% of the patients. Upright body posture also improved in most patients.  Although it is difficult to evaluate the cosmetic improvement objectively, this  was substantiated by patient and parental satisfaction.112 </p>
  <p><strong>Renal  Transplantation</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Deteriorating renal function from renal  dysplasia, recurrent pyelonephritis or reflux nephropathy are the reasons for  renal replacement therapy.&nbsp; The incidence  of renal transplantation in PBS patients is about 30%. 71&nbsp; Graft survival after renal transplantation in  PBS is similar to age matched controls, with graft survival of 75% versus 69%  in controls. 138  Compared with age matched controls 10 years post transplant, improved survival  of the renal graft was associated with pre-transplant urinary reconstruction to  reduce the chance of urinary stasis and infection, as well as maintaining low  post void residuals with timed voiding or clean intermittent catheterizations. 139&nbsp; Most transplants have been carried out&nbsp; without139  prior abdominoplasty. When large urinary residue and UTI was encountered  following transplantation, voiding efficiency and urinary infection improved  following abdominoplasty.140  Torsion of the graft is a potential complication in PBS possibly due to lack of  abdominal wall tone resulting in graft mobility.141  Prior abdominoplasty or nephropexy during transplantation have been recommended  to avoid torsion.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Long-term Outlook</em></strong></p>
  <p>Because of the  rarity of prune belly syndrome, most of the described literature is based on  case series. Outcome of neonates of Category I, born with pulmonary dysplasia  continues to be poor. In-hospital mortality of new-born patients with PBS dying  during their initial hospital stay is 31%.Prematurity and pulmonary disorders  were highly associated with in hospital mortality.10&nbsp; With better neonatal  care and efficient management of the urinary tract, survival has improved over  the years.&nbsp; With individualized treatment  plan and care, the  overall outlook for the PBS patient, both for survival and for quality of care,  has improved considerably, largely through advancements in neonatal care,  surgical techniques and diagnostic evaluation. Though aggressive surgical  approach may not be required in all patients, meticulous follow up and active  management of pyelonephritis and urinary tract obstruction are essential. A  third of those with impaired renal function at initial evaluation develop  chronic renal insufficiency during childhood or adolescence. Outcome of renal  transplantation seems comparable to age matched non-PBS patients. Bladder  dynamics and voiding pattern also may change over time. Hence, long-term  follow-up is essential to ensure near-normal quality of life for patients with prune  belly syndrome.<br>
