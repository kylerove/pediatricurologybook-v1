  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Duplex kidneys are a  relatively common abnormality.&nbsp; Duplex  kidneys may be associated with ureterocele, ectopic ureter insertion or vesicoureteric  reflux (VUR).&nbsp; This chapter will discuss  the terminology, incidence, embryology and pathophysiology of duplex kidneys.  The management of reflux into duplex kidneys, ectopic ureters and ureteroceles  will then be discussed.</p>
  <p>Single system ectopic  ureters and single system ureteroceles are distinct entities from those seen in  duplex kidneys.&nbsp; For convenience  discussion of the management of these conditions will be included in this  chapter.</p>
  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>The terminology  surrounding duplex kidneys has been conflicting.&nbsp; A standardized terminology was drawn up in  1984 by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and this has been widely  adopted (1):<br>
      <em>A duplex kidney</em> has two separate pelvicalyceal systems.<br>
      <em>A duplex or duplicated system</em> describes a renal unit in which the kidney has  two pelvicalyceal systems.&nbsp; It may  include a kidney with single or bifid ureters or two ureters that drain separately  into the bladder. <br>
      <em>A bifid system</em> has two pelvicalyceal systems that join at the  pelviureteric junction or two ureters (<em>bifid  ureters</em>) joining before entering the bladder.&nbsp; This represents a partial duplication.<br>
      <em>Double Ureters</em> are independent ureters that drain separately  into the urinary or genital tract, and are seen in complete duplication.<br>
      <em>Complete Duplication</em> occurs when there are double ureters draining separately.<br>
      <em>The upper (or lower) pole ureter</em> is the ureter that drains the upper (or lower)  pole of a duplex kidney. <br>
      <em>An ectopic ureter</em> is one that drains to an abnormal site.&nbsp; The term is often applied to a <em>caudal ectopic ureter</em>, which is one  where the orifice lies at the proximal lip of the bladder neck or beyond.<br>
      <em>An intravesical ureterocele</em> is one that lies entirely within the  bladder.&nbsp; It may also occur with a single  system.<br>
      <em>An ectopic ureterocele</em> is one where some portion of the ureterocele  is situated permanently at the bladder neck or in the urethra.<br>

  <h2>Incidence</h2>
  <p>The incidence of  duplex kidneys in post-mortem series is between 0.5-1.25% (2-4).</p>
  Duplex  kidneys were identified in 1.8% of intravenous urograms performed in 5196  patients.&nbsp; In 69 (73%) of these patients  the duplex kidney was considered to be an incidental finding (5). In this group, 30% of the duplex systems were  complete duplex systems.&nbsp; The incidence  of duplex kidneys is similar for left and right sides. Duplex kidneys are seen  approximately twice as frequently in females as males (4;5).&nbsp; Duplex  kidneys are bilateral in approximately one fifth.
  <p>The number of antenatally  detected cases is lower than the incidence observed in autopsy or radiology  series.&nbsp; In a series of 19,750 women  having antenatal scans, 13 foetus were identified with what was later confirmed  as duplex kidney yielding an incidence of 0.6% (6), which the authors thought was an overestimate  due to tertiary referral of complex kidneys.&nbsp;  In 6,292 pregnant women scanned by 28 weeks a 0.04% incidence of duplex  kidney was identified (7). </p>
  <p>There appears to be a  strong genetic predisposition.&nbsp; In those  with duplex kidneys, up to 30% have relatives with compete duplex kidneys and  two thirds with bifid systems, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance with  variable expression and incomplete penetrance (8-10). </p>
  <h2>Embryology</h2>
  The  kidney is formed when the ureteric bud, arising from the mesonephric duct,  meets the metanephros, and by a process of reciprocal induction brings about the  formation of the kidney.&nbsp; The distal part  of the ureteric bud eventually incorporates into the bladder to from the  trigone.&nbsp; At the cranial end branching of  the ureteric bud gives rise to the ureter, renal pelvis, calyces and collecting  ducts.&nbsp; Premature branching of the  ureteric bud results in an incomplete duplex with ureters that meet before the  bladder, or a bifid renal pelvis.&nbsp; If  more than one bud develops and migrates to the metanephros a duplex kidney with  two separate ureters forms.&nbsp; Initially  the more cranial ureteric bud connects to the upper pole.&nbsp; However as the ureteric bud incorporates into the  bladder, the upper pole ureteric bud rotates and migrates more caudally than the  lower pole ureteric bud.&nbsp; This results in  the upper pole ureter having an opening that is more caudal than the lower pole  ureter: an observation initially made by Weigert (11) and then independently by Meyer (12).&nbsp; This  is the Meyer Weigert Law.
  <p>The origin of the ureteric  bud on the mesonephric duct is important for how well the kidney develops.&nbsp; A bud that originates from the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; zone  of the mesonephric duct will strike the metanephros correctly and result in  good renal development.&nbsp; However if the  bud origin deviates from the normal zone, either too cranially or too caudally,  it does not meet the metanephros properly and a poorly-formed, dysplastic renal  segment results (13). &nbsp;Thus  the more abnormally sited a ureteric orifice the greater the likelihood that  the associated kidney pole of the duplex kidney will be abnormal and poorly  functioning.</p>
  The  cranial ureteric bud, which meets the upper moiety of the duplex, will migrate  more caudally.&nbsp; Ultimately its position  will be more medial and caudal than a normally situated ureteric orifice.&nbsp; This can result in a ureter that may insert  into the urogenital canal or mesonephric duct structures.&nbsp; In boys, this would include the bladder, the  prostatic urethra or the structures derived from the mesonephric duct: ejaculatory  duct, seminal vesicle, vas deferens, epididymis.&nbsp; These structures all lie above the external  urethral sphincter, and so will not cause incontinence.&nbsp; In girls, the ureter may insert into urogenital  canal structures: bladder, urethra or distal vagina.&nbsp; The mesonephric duct regresses in girls leaving  epo&ouml;phoron, parao&ouml;phoron or Gartner&rsquo;s cyst.&nbsp;  Insertion of the ureteric bud into these structures may result in  rupture through into adjacent  paramesonphric duct structures resulting in ureteric insertion into the  Fallopian tube, uterus or upper vagina.&nbsp; In  girls therefore, an ectopic ureter can result in continuous urinary incontinence.
  <p>A ureterocele is a ballooning  of the terminal ureter as it enters the bladder.&nbsp; The embryology of ureteroceles is not as  neatly explained and there are several theories.&nbsp; Persistence of a thin membrane of opposing  urogenital and ureteric epithelium at the insertion of the ureter into the  bladder may provide an explanation for obstructive ureteroceles (14).&nbsp; This  does not explain the existence of ureteroceles with large or non-obstructed openings.&nbsp; Perhaps independently of obstruction, there  may be an abnormality of collagen or muscle in the wall of the ureterocele (15;16).&nbsp; Another  possibility is late arrival or the ureteric bud into the bladder allowing the  ampullary origin of the ureteric bud to over-expand even before it has reached  the bladder (17). </p>
  <p>The development of a  caecoureterocele requires a more complex explanation.&nbsp; It is possible that the distal ureter is  affected by growth stimuli of adjacent structures.&nbsp; Stimulation of growth of the ureteric bud  causes enlargement of the distal ureter and its opening.&nbsp; Further expansion of the ureter is brought  about by the stimulus that causes bladder enlargement. Finally, a tongue of  this part of the ureter is carried distally by the caudal migration of the  M&#369;llerian bulbs (18).</p>
  <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
  At  first appearance the subject of duplex kidneys appears complex and daunting.&nbsp; However most of the clinical problems relate  to the way the ureters insert into the bladder.&nbsp;  It is worth repeating that the ureter from the upper pole of a duplex  kidney will have a more  distal/ medial insertion into the bladder than the ureter from the lower pole.&nbsp; The ureter from the lower pole can either  have a normal insertion or it can be associated with vesicoureteral reflux  (VUR). The ureter from the upper pole can have a normal insertion, insert  ectopically, or it may be associated with an ureterocele.&nbsp; Reflux, ectopic ureters and ureteroceles will  be discussed in more detail below.&nbsp; 
  <p>Although the lower  pole ureter is most commonly affected by reflux, it can sometimes be affected  by obstruction.&nbsp; This may occur as a  result of compression from a abnormal dilated upper pole ureter (18).&nbsp; Duplex  kidneys are susceptible to other pathologies; for example, pelviureteric  junction obstruction can affect the lower pole in up to 2% (19).</p>
  <p>The parenchyma of a  duplex kidney is not distributed equally between the two poles (Figure 1).</p>
  <p><img src="images/duplex-kidneys/Figure_1_ivu_showing_2_ureters.jpg" width="488" height="799"></p>
  <p>&nbsp; In an IVU series, normal kidneys were  observed to have a mean of 9.4 calyces whilst duplex kidneys had 11.3 calyces;  the upper pole having 3.7 calyces and the lower pole 7.6 calyces (5).&nbsp; In  general, the upper pole thus contributes about a third to the overall mass of  renal parenchyma.</p>
  <h2>Vesicoureteric reflux in duplex  kidneys</h2>
  <p>In general, the lower  pole ureter of a complete duplex inserts more laterally into the bladder and will  have a shorter and less oblique intramural course through the bladder wall than  a normal ureter.&nbsp; This makes it more  prone to reflux.</p>
  <p>Reflux is a common  finding in those with duplex kidneys.&nbsp; In  one retrospective series of 24 patients with duplex kidneys who had a  micturating cystogram, 15 (36%) were identified as having reflux (5).&nbsp; In a  series of children under the age of six years presenting with UTI, 23 of 35 (66%)  with complete duplex systems had VUR, grade III-V in 19 (54%).&nbsp; In the same series, 106 of 406 (26%) children  with simplex kidney systems had VUR, 48% grade III-V (20).&nbsp; Even  incomplete duplex systems seem to be associated with an increased incidence of  VUR, with 17 of 36 (47%) systems affected eight with grade III-V reflux.&nbsp; In another study of girls presenting with  UTI, 25 of 36 (69%) with complete duplex systems were found to have reflux (21): in 72% reflux was to the lower pole only, to  upper and lower poles in 20%, and 8% of reflux was to the upper pole only.&nbsp; In 18 partial duplex kidneys VUR occurred in  four (22%).&nbsp; These figures are similar to  a 76% incidence of reflux in complete renal duplication detected by Fehrenbaker  in a series of children presenting with UTI (22).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Lower pole VUR in duplex  kidneys most commonly presents with UTI, with only a minority presenting on antenatal  scans (23).&nbsp; If the  lower moiety kidney is dysplastic or scarred, hypertension is another way the  lower pole reflux may come to urological attention.&nbsp; Pain is an unusual presentation and other  causes of loin pain should be looked for. </p>
  <p>Investigation by  ultrasound may show a dilated lower pole or dilated ureter (see Figure 2).&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="images/duplex-kidneys/Figure_2_US_lower_ple_dialtion.jpg" width="800" height="538"></p>
  <p> In infants, a micturating cystogram gives  accurate information about the anatomy of the reflux.&nbsp; A Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)  radionucleotide scan provides information about the function of the affected  pole, and information about focal scarring (see Figure 3).</p>
  <p><img src="images/duplex-kidneys/Figure_3_DMSA.jpg" width="800" height="391"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The natural history of  VUR in duplex kidneys is one of spontaneous resolution in a large  proportion.&nbsp; Rates of spontaneous  resolution of VUR of 58% have been observed in those treated non-surgically (24). Spontaneous resolution of VUR in complete  duplex kidneys is comparable to single kidneys (26), with 85% resolution of grade I-II and 36%  resolution for grade III (25). However a more recent study found that when  higher grades of reflux are included in the comparison the rate of spontaneous  resolution is not as good (23).&nbsp; Only  7% of grade III VUR in duplex kidneys resolved, and none of the higher grades  of VUR resolved over a mean follow-up of three and a half years.</p>
  <p>The anatomy of the  insertion of a refluxing lower pole ureter will make surgery more difficult.&nbsp; Therefore when formulating a management plan  for a patient with a duplex kidney, it is especially important to be clear  about the goal of treatment before embarking on a surgical plan.&nbsp; It is not appropriate to treat reflux in a  duplex kidney simply because it is there.&nbsp;  Indications for surgery for VUR in duplex kidneys are similar to those  for reflux into single systems: failure of medical therapy to control pyrexial  infections, or to prevent new scars.</p>
  A  robust treatment of a refluxing duplex ureter is to re-implant it.&nbsp; Doing this necessitates that the lower pole  and upper pole ureters are mobilized together in their common sheath and  re-implanted together (27).&nbsp; A range  of common-sheath intravesical re-implantations techniques in a series of 48  duplex renal units produced a 96% success rate in curing reflux (28).&nbsp; More  recently there has been interest in extravesical detrusorrhaphy, which has the  benefit of avoiding cystostomy.&nbsp; Success rates of 98% have been  reported in a series of 51 units (29), or 95% in at series of 65 units (30).&nbsp; The  procedure carries a risk of urinary retention, with 5% of children requiring a  further two weeks of an indwelling urinary catheter and one patient requiring 6  weeks of intermittent catheterization (30).
  <p>Recently, there has  been a interest in performing ureteric re-implants laparoscopically or more  accurately vesicoscopically (31;32).&nbsp; Two  series demonstrate that it is technically possible to perform the procedure in duplex  kidneys.&nbsp; However, at the time of writing,  the long-term success of vesicoscopic ureteric re-implantation in patients with  duplex kidneys has yet to be reported. </p>
  <p>Uretero-ureterostomy is  an alternative treatment.&nbsp; The diseased donor  ureter is disconnected and anastomosed to the recipient ureter lying  alongside.&nbsp; In the treatment of VUR, the  advantages of this procedure are that there is no need to open the bladder, nor  to perform ureteric tapering if the ureter is very dilated. Uretero-ureterostomy  was originally described by Buchtel (33).&nbsp; The  indications for uretero-ureterostomy extend beyond lower pole reflux to include  treatment of ureters that are ectopic, associated with an ureterocele or have  upper pole reflux.&nbsp; Published success  rates are impressive (34-39).&nbsp;  Potential complications include obstruction at the site of the anastomosis,  yo-yo reflux through the anastomosis, or reflux into the retained ureteric  stump.&nbsp; There has been renewed interest  in the technique with the application of laparoscopic techniques either to make  a distal ureteric anastomosis (40), or a more proximal anastomosis (41).</p>
  <p>Endoscopic injection  therapy to treat reflux is now widespread for single system kidneys.&nbsp; Initial concern about applying this method to  ureters, with a significant co-existing anatomical abnormality such as a duplex  ureter, seemed to be borne out by an early meta-analysis giving injection  therapy a 50% success rate for duplex kidneys compared to 73% in single system  kidneys.&nbsp; However a more recent review,  which included a greater number of studies looking at duplex kidneys, gave  injection therapy a much better account (42).&nbsp; This meta-analysis  of injection treatment for reflux gave a success rate of 64% for duplex kidneys  and 68% for single system kidneys, with no statistically significant difference  between the two groups.</p>
  <p>Where the lower pole  of the duplex kidney is beyond salvage, its removal by hemi-nephrectomy is advocated  (43;44).&nbsp;  Removal of the lower pole can be slightly more difficult than an upper pole  hemi-nephrectomy as the lower pole nests into the upper pole and so is trickier  to separate.&nbsp; It can be difficult to  access the most distal ureter from the approach required to perform a lower  pole hemi-nephrectomy, so that a second incision may be required to completely  remove the lower pole ureter.&nbsp; Fortunately  reflux into the ureteric stump is not often a problem and a subsequent stump  ureterectomy is required in less than 5% (45;46). &nbsp;A drop  in differential function of the remaining renal moiety of about 6% following  hemi-nephrectomy has been reported (47).&nbsp; It is  not certain whether this represent a true drop or is the effect of the way  regions of interest are drawn on renograms.&nbsp; </p>
  Hemi-nephrectomy  is increasingly performed laparoscopically or retroperitonoscopically.&nbsp; These procedures are challenging, although  outcomes equivalent to open surgery are reported (48-51). Urinary cysts and loss of function of the remaining moiety  are complications that have been described with an incidence as high as 9% (49).
  <h2>Ectopic ureters in duplex kidneys</h2>
  <p>Ectopic ureters are a  relatively uncommon problem relating to duplex kidneys.&nbsp; In one series of children whose duplex kidneys  were detected after presentation with UTI only one out of 35 (3%) was found to  have had an ectopic ureter (20).</p>
  <p>The problems caused by  ectopic ureters relate to the way they insert into the genitourinary  tract.&nbsp; In girls, ectopic ureters that  drain below the level of the sphincter will result in continuous urinary incontinence.&nbsp; In boys, low ectopic insertion will result in  the ureter draining into a mesonephric duct structure: ejaculatory duct, seminal  vesicle, vas deferens or epididymis.&nbsp;  Drainage into these structures may result in recurrent epididymo-orchitis.&nbsp; Ectopic insertion of ureters outside the  bladder may result in impaired drainage, is associated with dilation and  urinary tract infection.</p>
  Identifying  the presence of an ectopic ureter associated with a duplex kidney can be  difficult.&nbsp; This relates to the original  embryology of the ectopic ureter and the position of origin of the ureteric bud  giving rise to the ectopic ureter.&nbsp; The  further the origin of the ectopic ureter bud from the normal zone, the greater  the likelihood of impaired function and dysplasia of the related renal moeity (13).&nbsp; In  practice, this means that the upper pole of a duplex kidney with an ectopic ureter  may be very small and poorly functioning.&nbsp;  Its small size makes it difficult to identify on morphological imaging,  whilst its poor function means that when functional imaging is performed there is  minimal uptake of tracer or contrast (52).&nbsp; Finding  the opening to an ectopic ureter at cystoscopy or vaginoscopy  may be difficult.&nbsp; It is therefore easy  to understand the origin of the term &ldquo;cryptic duplex&rdquo; in relation to ectopic  ureters.&nbsp; Identification of a duplex  kidney with an ectopic ureter requires a high index of suspicion from the outset  (52;53).
  <p>Clinical examination  of a girl with an ectopic ureter may identify continuous dripping of urine from  the introitus.&nbsp; There may be perineal  irritation from continuous leaking.&nbsp; It is  sometimes possible to identify continuous leaking by asking the girl to sit  directly on the paper towel covering an examination couch.&nbsp; After a few minutes the leaking will be  confirmed by an area of wetness on the paper.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Renal ultrasound and  antenatal scanning may provide a clue about the presence of an ectopic ureter  if there is dilation of the ectopic ureter or its upper pole kidney.</p>
  <p>In the past, intravenous  urograms helped diagnose ectopic ureters.&nbsp;  The upper pole does not effectively excrete contrast during the study,  so its presence is alluded to by the absence of the upper pole calyces.&nbsp; A pelvicalyceal pattern described as the  &ldquo;drooping lily&rdquo; is seen, with the ureter, pelvis and lower pole calyces  opacifying (Figure1).&nbsp; Further clues are  provided by a smaller number of calyces than expected and the abnormal axis of  the visualised pelvicalyceal system. Today, intravenous urograms are now so  rarely performed in children that the skills required to identify these subtle  changes are probably not adequately practiced in most radiology departments.</p>
  <p>CT scanning with  contrast has been suggested as a possible investigation to successfully  identify duplex kidneys with ectopic ureters (55). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is probably  a more useful test where a suspected upper pole of a potential duplex kidney  has been hard to identify.&nbsp; It can pick  up 10% more duplex kidneys than ultrasound (56-58).&nbsp; Even  so, careful image acquisition and interpretation are required to maximize  sensitivity.&nbsp; Allowing a delay for the  upper pole to take up contrast may enhance the sensitivity of the MRI scan.</p>
  <p>A reflection of how  difficult it can be to identify ectopic ureters is the number of tests that  have been suggested to help secure the diagnosis. &nbsp;Intravenous administration of indigo carmine (59) or bladder instillation of methylene blue have  been suggested as methods to identify ectopic ureters by differential staining  of urine from the ectopic and normal urinary tracts.&nbsp; Careful targeted cystoscopy and vaginoscopy  may locate an ectopic ureteric opening, but identification can be difficult and  the opening easily missed (52).</p>
  <p>Ectopic ureters inserting  into the urinary tract are frequently associated with reflux observed on  micturating cystogram.&nbsp; A ureter placed  above the sphincter will demonstrate the reflux during filling; a ureter placed  below the sphincter will demonstrate reflux during voiding (54).</p>
  Treatment  of a symptomatic ectopic ureter requires surgery.&nbsp; The upper pole kidney associated with an  ectopic ureter is usually poorly functioning and so is appropriately treated by  upper pole hemi-nephrectomy (60;61). &nbsp;Retaining the distal ureteric stump carries a  less than 10% &nbsp;chance of re-operation for  distal ureteric removal, whilst reducing the morbidity  from a complete ureterectomy (62;63). &nbsp;Laparoscopic methods have been applied to hemi-nephrectomy  (48;49;51;64).&nbsp; As  with lower pole hemi-nephrectomy the laparoscopic procedure is challenging,  with risks of retroperitoneal fluid collection, loss of renal tissue and  hypertension.
  <p>Where upper pole  function is preserved, an alternative to hemi-nephrectomy is ureteric  re-implantation.&nbsp; In this case, both  ureters from the duplex kidney should be re-implanted together.&nbsp; Re-implantation, however, can be avoided by  draining the upper pole into the lower pole system either with an uretero-ureterostomy  or a uretero-pyelostomy (65). Today, laparoscopy has progressed to such reconstruction,  and both laparoscopic uretero-ureterostomy and uretero-pyelostomy are described  (41;66).</p>
  <h2>Ureterocele</h2>
  <p>Describing  ureteroceles as obstructive does not give an adequate account of the  differences in how they behave.&nbsp; The AAP  classification of ureteroceles (1), which distinguishes intravesical and ectopic  ureteroceles, has the advantage of being simple and is widely used.&nbsp; Another classification regularly encountered  in the literature was developed by Stephens et al (18).&nbsp; This  classification is described below and includes differences in the way that  ureteroceles act:</p>
  <h3>Stenotic</h3>
  <p>This is the most  common type of ureterocele.&nbsp; The  ureterocele lies within the bladder. Its orifice lies within the trigone and is  obstructive. It corresponds to an intravesical ureterocele.</p>
  <h3>Sphincteric</h3>
  <p>In this form of  ureterocele, a rather dilated ureter courses through the submucosa of the  bladder, and adopts a more normal calibre as it travels into the urethra. It has  an opening at the level of the sphincter.&nbsp;  Its orifice is not narrow, but drainage from the ureterocele is impaired  by contraction of the sphincter. The associated ureterocele can be very large.</p>
  <h3>Sphincterostenotic</h3>
  <p>Here the ureterocele  has an orifice that is at the level of the sphincter.&nbsp; Its narrow orifice further impedes its  drainage so that the ureterocele remains inflated and obstructs the bladder  outlet.</p>
  <h3>Blind</h3>
  <p>This form of  ureterocele extends under the trigone and into the bladder outlet. No opening  is identifiable.&nbsp; The dilated ureterocele  can cause severe bladder outlet obstruction.</p>
  <h3>Non-obstructive</h3>
  <p>This type of ureterocele  lies entirely within the bladder, and has a large opening which does not impede  drainage of the ureterocele.</p>
  <h3>Caecoureterocele</h3>
  This  form of ureterocele extends submucosally into the urethra.&nbsp; The orifice of the ureterocele lies more proximally  either in the urethra or the bladder.&nbsp; A  &ldquo;tongue&rdquo; of submucosal ureterocele lies caudal to the opening.&nbsp; If its opening is small, filling of the  ureterocele may obstruct the bladder outlet.&nbsp;  If the ureterocele has a large opening (either naturally or  iatrogenically) the tongue of the caecoureterocele will fill by reflux during  voiding and may obstruct the urethra.
  <p>In a series of 60 ureteroceles: 40% were stenotic, one third  sphincteric, 6% sphincterostenotic, 5% blind, 5% non-obstructive, and 5% a caecoureterocele  (18).</p>
  <h3>Presentation</h3>
  <p>The incidence of  ureterocele at post-mortem is 1 in 500-4,000 (67;68). &nbsp;In  patients who are identified as having duplex kidneys, 5-20% will be found to  have ureteroceles (20;21).&nbsp; The  majority of ureteroceles used to present with urinary tract infection.&nbsp; With improvement in antenatal scanning half  to three quarters are detected antenatally (69-72).</p>
  <p>It is common for  ureteroceles to obstruct the upper pole of the affect kidney from which they  have arisen (73).&nbsp; It is  possible for further obstruction to occur.&nbsp;  The lower pole ureter may be obstructed by the dilated upper pole  ureter.&nbsp; A ureterocele that obstructs the  bladder outlet will affect the contralateral kidney as well. </p>
  <p>Co-existing vesicoureteric  reflux is common, affecting the ipsilateral lower pole in half, and the contralateral  kidney in a quarter (74). Abnormal bladder function is common in  children with ureterocele.&nbsp; More than  half will have abnormally large bladders, and residual volumes are common (75).&nbsp; Stones  have been observed in a large proportion of adult patients presenting with  ureterocele (76).<br>

  <h3>Investigation</h3>
  <p>Investigation of a  ureterocele is aimed at confirming its presence, describing its structure (intravesical  or ectopic) and identifying coexisting pathology (e.g. VUR, lower pole and  bladder outlet obstruction).</p>
  <p>The ureterocele and  its associated dilated ureter and upper pole are usually identified on  ultrasound (see Figure 4).</p>
  <p><img src="images/duplex-kidneys/Figure_4_bladderUS.jpg" width="800" height="541"></p>
  <p>&nbsp; Care should  be taken that a dilated distal ureter adjacent to a bladder is not mistaken for  a ureterocele.&nbsp; A ureterocele that is  collapsed may be missed at the time of ultrasound scanning.&nbsp; A careful ultrasound can give useful  information about the extent of the ureterocele and the thickness of its  posterior wall.</p>
  <p>Micturating cystogram is  an invaluable investigation in the patient with a ureterocele (see Figure 5).</p>
  <p><img src="images/duplex-kidneys/Figure_5aMCUG_ureterocele.jpg" width="487" height="542"></p>
  <p>&nbsp; It identifies its size, and the relationship  of the fundus and base of the ureterocele to the bladder neck and urethra,  indicating possible bladder outlet obstruction. Additional baseline information  about VUR is obtained.&nbsp; Care should be  taken that an everted ureterocele is not miss-identified as a paraureteric  diverticulum (77).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A Dimercaptosuccinic  acid (DMSA) radionucleotide scan is useful to confirm poor function in the  upper pole and also provides a baseline prior to surgery.</p>
  A  combination of ultrasound and micturating cystogram can often distinguish intravesical  from ectopic ureteroceles.&nbsp; However this  is not always possible, and cystoscopy may be required to make the distinction  in up to a quarter (78).&nbsp; When performing cystoscopy  care must be taken not to obliterate the ureterocele; ideally the patient  should be well hydrated, and irrigation flow kept to a minimum.
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>Given the complexity and  variation in the anatomy of ureteroceles, it is perhaps not surprising that  there is no clear consensus on the management of ureteroceles.&nbsp; The goals of treatment can be  conflicting:&nbsp; the aim of minimising  damage from obstruction of the upper tract and the bladder, the desire to offer  single or minimal treatments, the goal of avoiding iatrogenic problems such as  new reflux or bladder outlet obstruction, and the desire to effect definite  anatomical correction.&nbsp; Thus there are  several possible treatment approaches that can be offered to a patient with a  ureterocele, with distinct recommendations made for intravesical and ectopic  ureteroceles. Broadly, the treatment options range between conservative  treatment, ureterocele puncture, upper pole hemi-nephrectomy and ureterocele  excision with bladder neck repair and re-implantation. </p>
  <h3>Conservative  treatment</h3>
  <p>Expectant management  of antenatally detected ureteroceles may be a successful treatment avoiding  potentially difficult surgery and its complications.&nbsp; Leaving dysplastic renal tissue in situ may  not pose an increased risk of hypertension (79). The main concern over expectant management of  ureteroceles is the predisposition of an obstructed hydronephrotic kidney to  infection.</p>
  Non-surgical  treatment of ureteroceles was suggested by Rickwood et al (80).&nbsp; They reported  on the outcome of ureterocele treatment, and observed that a subgroup treated expectantly  did very well.&nbsp; This was subsequently  elaborated on.&nbsp; Patients with ureterocele  with poorly functioning upper poles, and reflux of less than grade IV (making  up 27% of their patients with ureterocele) did not develop infection or require  surgery over a median follow up of 8 years, often with an improvement in  hydronephrosis, or collapse of the ureterocele (81).
  <p>In a different series,  13 patients were selected for conservative treatment on the basis of non-obstruction  on their mercapto-acetyl-triglycine<strong> </strong>(MAG3) scan and grade III or  less VUR and followed for a median of four years (72). Only four required operation for break  through infection or increasing dilation.&nbsp;  In those who were managed non-surgically, all VUR resolved.</p>
  <p>Successful  conservative treatment was also reported by Direnna and Leonard (82).&nbsp; A  select minority of their patients (with no lower pole or bladder neck obstruction,  less than grade IV reflux, and upper poles that drained if they were  functioning) had no infection and required no surgery after a median follow-up  of five years.&nbsp; In four patients the hydronephrosis  improved and in one the ureterocele collapsed. Reflux improved or resolved in  three out of four with lower pole reflux.</p>
  <p>This approach can be  successfully applied to ureteroceles associated with a multicystic dysplastic  kidney (83), with only one UTI in a group of those being  treated expectantly.</p>
  Sauvage  et al, initially took a different stance (84). However, on assessing their outcomes from  surgery for ureterocele, they were disappointed by their own operative results. They suggested  that a period of careful observation might be useful in stratifying which  patients actually require surgery and in which surgery can be altogether avoided.
  <h3>Upper pole  hemi-nephrectomy</h3>
  <p>This treatment  strategy is sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;simple treatment&rdquo;. The upper pole of  the kidney associated with a significant ureterocele usually has minimal function.&nbsp; Removing the upper pole by hemi-nephrectomy  will remove an obstructed system predisposed to urinary tract infection.&nbsp; Removal, combined with suction of the distal  ureter at the time of operation will also bring about collapse and  decompression of the ureterocele. &nbsp;Co-existing reflux to the lower pole is then  expected to resolve in the majority (85).&nbsp; However,  Husmann et al found reflux was not solved by hemi-nephrectomy; 15% of those  without &nbsp;pre-existing reflux developed  reflux, and reflux continued after hemi-nephrectomy in 84% of those with  pre-existing reflux (86).</p>
  <p>A significant advantage  of hemi-nephrectomy is that difficult surgery at the bladder neck and distal  ureter is avoided and re-operation is evaded in 85% (87;88).&nbsp; Incontinence  following hemi-nephrectomy has been reported in 6% (89).&nbsp;  Bladder dysfunction is probably an inherent problem associated with ureterocele  and not related to hemi-nephrectomy.&nbsp; Nevertheless,  there is a concern that the simple approach may be associated with UTI, diverticula  and even bladder outlet obstruction (90).</p>
  One  group reports a success rate of 80% for the simple approach (70).&nbsp; This is  slightly worse than the re-operation rate for bladder neck reconstruction in  the same study. However, the authors noted that reconstruction was associated  with more severe complications. They  therefore recommend the simple approach for the majority of patients in the  absence of high grade reflux.
  <p>A further modification  is to perform upper pole hemi-nephrectomy laparoscopically (91;92).&nbsp; This  is a technically difficult procedure even for an experienced laparoscopic  surgeon.&nbsp; Conversion to open is required  in upto 12.5%, perirenal collections are seen in a fifth, and it is not yet  clear if the re-operation rate is comparable to open hemi-nephrectomy.</p>
  <h3>Ureterocele  puncture/endoscopic treatment</h3>
  <p>Endoscopic treatment  of ureteroceles by puncture is a potentially very attractive solution.&nbsp; Puncturing the ureterocele using cystoscopy  is an operation with much lower perioperative morbidity than the alternatives  of upper pole nephrectomy or bladder neck reconstruction.&nbsp; It can almost be performed as day-case  surgery.&nbsp; An individual puncture carries  only a 10-20% chance of repeat puncture being required (69;93;94).&nbsp; It may  even be possible that some upper pole function may be recovered.</p>
  <p>Recovery of upper pole  function following ureterocele puncture is often cited as a reason for  performing ureterocele puncture (95).&nbsp; One  series of neonatal ureterocele puncture managed to produce a mean upper pole  function of 8% (96).&nbsp; However  recovered function is likely to be limited if underlying poor function is because  of dysplasia rather than obstruction (80;97-99), and histology studies often indicate dysplasia  rather than inflammation to be the main feature in the upper pole. </p>
  The  main criticism of ureterocele puncture as a treatment modality is the need for  further surgery, despite adequate decompression.&nbsp; In a meta-analysis of 912 patients undergoing endoscopic  treatment of their ureteroceles 47% went on to have further surgery (100).&nbsp; The  chance of re-operation is higher when the ureterocele is ectopic compared to  intravesical (relative risk 2.78), in a duplex system compared to a single  system (relative risk 1.41) or if there is pre-existing reflux (relative risk  1.56).&nbsp; With extended and longer term  follow-up the re-operation rate can climb to 71% (69;101).
  <p>The most common  indication for re-operation is VUR.&nbsp; This  can affect half the patients having a ureterocele puncture (94;95) and commonly affects the upper pole in about a  third (102).&nbsp;  Ureterocele puncture can result in resolution of some pre-existing VUR (103). &nbsp;Treatment of VUR following ureterocele  puncture has usually been by reconstruction.&nbsp;  However, the minimally invasive approach of ureterocele puncture has  been extended by some groups to the treatment of VUR, with success rates of  60-70% reported for cystoscopic injection therapy (103-105).</p>
  <p>Antenatal diagnosis of  ureteroceles opens the possibility of antenatal intervention for ureteroceles.&nbsp; Puncture of ureterocele may be considered <em>in utero</em> where there are features of  bladder outlet obstruction, for example where there is oligo- or anhydramnios.&nbsp; There are case reports of successful foetal  intervention (106-110), but results of larger case series and longer  follow-up are awaited.</p>
  Puncture  should not be regarded as a universal treatment for ureterocele but should have  a defined role.&nbsp; For the child presenting  with an acute infection it can provide emergency relief of obstruction (70;86).&nbsp;  Puncture has a high success rate for intravesical ureteroceles, and for  these puncture can be offered as a definitive treatment (100;111-114).&nbsp; For  ectopic ureteroceles, a high rate of re-operation should be expected.&nbsp; Here, ureterocele puncture should be viewed  as part of a staged procedure: either making subsequent reconstructive surgery  easier (69;115), or enabling VUR to be controlled  cystoscopically (103-105).
  <h3>Bladder  neck reconstruction</h3>
  <p>The intent of bladder  neck reconstruction in the management of ureterocele is correcting the  anatomical abnormalities that are encountered with ureteroceles.&nbsp; It may include all or part of the following:&nbsp; excision of the ureterocele, repairing the weakness  of the bladder neck and bladder wall, re-implantation of the associated  ureters, and hemi-nephrectomy of a poorly functioning upper pole.&nbsp; Marsupialisation of the ureterocele, rather  than its complete excision, may be performed to avoid difficult dissection in  the urethra (116).&nbsp; The  benefit of reconstruction is that the functional problems associated with the  ureterocele can all be corrected: VUR, sphincter weakness, and bladder outlet  obstruction from the ureterocele, primarily or iatrogenically created (90).&nbsp; </p>
  Reconstruction  may be offered as either the primary or secondary treatment.&nbsp; Reconstruction surgery is difficult, especially  when performed on a young infant.&nbsp; In  early life the risk of UTI is a particular concern, and so ureterocele puncture  may be performed to control this early risk.&nbsp;  Reconstruction can then be performed at an age when reconstruction  surgery is easier. Alternatively reconstruction has been performed as a primary  procedure with good effect.&nbsp; Excellent  results were reported in a group of 16 patients undergoing primary repair with  a mean follow up of more than five years (115). In a series of 40 patients with ectopic  ureterocele reported by De Jong et al (78), all underwent upper pole hemi-nephrectomy, ureterocele  excision, bladder neck reconstruction, re-implantation and even colposuspension  at a single operation.&nbsp; All children became clinically continent, although  many children had a tendency to void infrequently, five requiring biofeedback  because of bladder-sphincter dysfunction, three requiring temporary  intermittent catheterization.&nbsp; The same  group reported longer term follow up of similar patients (117). After a median follow-up of 9 years, 31% of  patients who were treated with primary bladder surgery required re-operation.  Re-operation was performed endoscopically in all, either for reflux or obstructive  voiding.&nbsp; Incontinence was seen in 7%, and  20% had dysfunctional voiding requiring bio-feedback.&nbsp; 
  <p>A more sanguine view  of reconstruction is provided by others.&nbsp;  One series reported a success rate of 83% for primary reconstruction,  but the authors warned of the possibility of major complications for this  difficult surgery (70). &nbsp;In  another a series of girls undergoing reconstruction for bilateral ureterocele,  70% had significant post-operative residuals and a fifth needed to perform  intermittent catheterization (118). &nbsp;Another group reported a 20% incidence of UTI  following reconstruction, and a 13% incidence of bladder dysfunction (119).</p>
  <h3>Uretero-ureterostomy</h3>
  Connecting  the drainage of the upper pole ureter to the lower pole is another technique  that can be applied to children with ureterocele.&nbsp; Anastomozing one ureter to the other less  diseased ureter is relatively simple and may avoid problems of ureterocele  excision and bladder neck reconstruction (38;120;121).&nbsp; This is  a procedure which carries less morbidity than hemi-nephrectomy or reconstruction.&nbsp; A 91% success rate for the treatment of ureteroceles  has been reported, with a patent anastomosis, and without reflux or obstruction  (38).&nbsp; Another  series reported success after two year follow up in eight children with  ureterocele but no reflux (121). &nbsp;
  <p>Uretero-ureterostomy  may be combined with ureteric re-implantation of the less dilated ureter with  good outcome (39). </p>
  <p>One of the advantages  of uretero-ureterostomy is that it can be performed through a small  incision.&nbsp; However, even this morbidity  may be reduced by performing the operation laparoscopically (40;41).</p>
  <p>In conclusion, no  single procedure provides a universal treatment for all ureteroceles.&nbsp; A few generalisations may be made:  ureterocele puncture is appropriate for emergency decompression of acutely  infected systems and for intravesical ureteroceles; upper pole hemi-nephrectomy  carries a good success rate where there is no associated reflux.&nbsp; Even so, the treatment for ureteroceles should  be tailored to the individual patient.</p>
  <h2>Single system ureterocele </h2>
  <p>A fifth of all ureteroceles  occur in single systems, as opposed to duplex systems (122;123).&nbsp; Single  system ureteroceles are most commonly intravesical and the associated kidneys  often have reasonable function.&nbsp; The  majority of single system ureteroceles presenting in childhood are detected  antenatally (124).</p>
  <p>Investigation should  begin with a renal ultrasound.&nbsp; Hydronephrosis  may be absent in up to two thirds (125).&nbsp; They  can often be small and missed. Vesicoureteric reflux into the ureterocele is  not seen (124;125).&nbsp; MAG3  scanning is useful to quantify function in the affected kidneys, and to provide  information about drainage of the affected system.</p>
<p>If there is no  obstruction or reflux of the affected kidney then non-surgical treatment is  appropriate (82) and good outcomes should be expected from  conservative treatment &nbsp;If the  ureterocele impairs the drainage of an affected kidney then surgery is indicated.  Transurethral puncture or incision of the ureterocele is much more likely to be  successful in simplex system ureteroceles than in duplex kidneys.&nbsp; Re-operation rates for ureteroceles in single  systems are low, with rates of 0-25% quoted (95;112;113;126). </p>
  <h2>Single system ectopic ureter</h2>
  <p>About one fifth of ectopic  ureters are associated with single system kidneys (127).&nbsp; Some  report that they are more common in boys (128-130), others that there is a female preponderance  in India and Japan (131;132), and yet others found an equal distribution in boys and girls (133).</p>
  <p>Single system ectopic  ureters are frequently associated with other congenital problems, including  anorectal, oesophageal and renal tract anomalies (128;129;133).&nbsp; About  half of those with single system ectopic ureters present during investigation  of other anomalies, the remainder with either incontinence or infection.&nbsp; </p>
  Renal  dysplasia is common.&nbsp; However, unlike  duplex ectopic ureters, single system ectopic ureters are associated with  kidneys with reasonable function.&nbsp; For  example, in one series of single system ectopic ureters, three-quarters of the  kidneys were worth preserving (132).&nbsp; Another  series found that five out of twelve kidneys associated with single ectopic ureters  were dysplastic, and two out of the twelve kidneys were absent (134). 
  <p>Diagnosis of single  system ectopic ureters can prove difficult.&nbsp;  On micturating cystogram, reflux can be demonstrated in only half (128). Initial cystoscopy can fail to identify the  ectopic ureter in two-thirds (134).</p>
  <h3>Bilateral  ectopic ureter</h3>
  <p>Bilateral ectopic  ureters are a rare and distinct malformation affecting girls (133). Neither ureter drains into the bladder which  is small with a poorly developed sphincter.&nbsp;  It is possible that during development the abnormal origin of both  ureteric bud results in poor mesenchymal induction of the urogenital  structures.&nbsp; This results in failure of normal  development of the bladder and the bladder neck.&nbsp; Both the sphincter and reservoir functions of  the bladder are severely effected (135;136).&nbsp; Thus  although the child may present with incontinence, ureteric re-implantation will  fail to correct the incontinence (137).&nbsp; One  review of the literature back to 1937 found that despite surgery only 20%  became continent (138). </p>
  Achieving  continence requires ureteric re-implantation, improvement of bladder storage  and improvement in bladder outlet resistance.&nbsp;  Ureteric re-implantation is difficult because of the small bladder  size.&nbsp; Creation of a window between a  distal ureter and the bladder may, by allowing bladder cycling, allow  reasonable bladder capacity to develop and possibly avoid the need for bladder  outlet procedures and augmentation (119;139) .&nbsp; Bladder  capacity may be improved with enterocystoplasty.&nbsp; A variety of bladder outlet procedures have  been described in this context: Young- 
  <p>Dees-Leadbetter  bladder neck reconstruction (140), Kropp procedure, pubovaginal sling (136), bladder neck closure (141), and artificial urinary sphincter (142;143).</p>
  <h2>Legend to Figures</h2>
  <h3>Figure 1:  Intravenous urogram of an uncomplicated right duplex kidney.</h3>
  <p>Note that the majority  of the calyces belong to the lower pole.&nbsp;  In a situation where the upper pole is non-functioning and dilated, one  can imagine that the lower pole calyces are displaced inferiorly and laterally  giving the appearance of a &ldquo;drooping lily&rdquo;.</p>
