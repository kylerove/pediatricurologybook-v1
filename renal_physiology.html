  <p><strong>Overview  of renal function:</strong><br>
The kidneys play a critical role in the  normal health and development of children. The nephron is the functioning unit  of the kidney, with each kidney containing ~500,000-1,000,000 nephrons. Cumulatively,  the basic processes of the nephron are 1) filtration, 2) reabsorption, and 3)  secretion. </p>
  <p><img src="/2017/renphys01.jpg" width="338" height="275"></p>
  <p>Each nephron has 5 main parts:  1) the glomerulus, 2) the proximal tubule, 3) the loop of Henle, 4) the distal  convoluted tubule, and 5) the collecting ducts (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). The glomeruli (&lsquo;filters&rsquo;) have both charge and size  selectivity and filter plasma across the endothelial (capillary), glomerular  basement membrane, and epithelial (podocyte) layers. (See below regarding  assessment of filtration.) The proximal tubule (&lsquo;workhorse&rsquo;) is where  approximately 85% of reabsorption occurs &ndash; including sodium, water, amino  acids, and glucose. The loop of Henle allows for dilution and subsequent  concentration of urine via the counter current multiplier.&nbsp; The distal convoluted tubule contains the  macula densa which is critical for juxtaglomerular feedback with subsequent  autoregulation of renal blood flow. Autoregulation allows for a fairly constant  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under normal physiological circumstances.  Finally, the collecting ducts respond to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), which  allows for concentration of urine, as well as aldosterone which allows for  secretion of potassium. <br>
  </p>
  <p><img src="/2017/renalphys02.jpg" width="290" height="188"></p>
  <p>Beyond filtration, the kidneys also control  volume and blood pressure (via both response to anti-diuretic hormone as well  as the renin angiotensin aldosterone system), regulate electrolyte balance,  help regulate serum pH, convert inactive 25-hydroxy vitamin D to active 1-25-dihydroxyvitaminD,  and secrete epogen. </p>
  <p><strong>Assessing  renal function:</strong><br>
Despite the complexity of filtration,  reabsorption and secretion along the nephron, assessment of nephron function  can be simplified into 1) filtration (glomeruli) and 2) tubular function. </p>
  <ol>
    <li><u>Assessment of Filtration</u></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the  rate at which plasma is cumulatively filtered through the nephrons. After  filtration, most of the filtered load is reabsorbed along the nephron. In  pediatrics, the Schwartz equation is most commonly used to estimate GFR in  children[1]. The Schwartz equation (<strong>Figure  2</strong>) is based on serum creatinine as well as the child&rsquo;s height. While a  normal GFR in adults is ~120 mL/min/1.73m2, in pediatrics a normal  GFR varies depending on a child&rsquo;s age. Typically, a full-term neonate&rsquo;s initial  GFR is only ~30 mL/min/1.73m2 while a premature neonate&rsquo;s initial GFR  can be even lower ~15 mL/min/1.73m2. Regardless of gestational age,  GFR roughly doubles within 2 weeks of age because of decreasing vascular  resistance with a resultant increase in renal blood flow and perfusion. GFR  then continues to increase (corrected for body surface area) and reaches adult  norms about about 19 months of age. </p>
  <p><img src="/2017/renalphys03.jpg" width="326" height="130"></p>
  <ol>
    <li><u>Assessment of Tubular  function</u></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Tubular function can be assessed via  electrolyte balance as well as the ability to concentrate and dilute urine. Tubulopathies  can often be successfully diagnosed via interpretation of electrolyte  abnormalities[2]. For example, tubular wasting of sodium, phosphorus, potassium,  amino acids and glucose should precipitate an evaluation for Fanconi syndrome.  Fanconi syndrome occurs when there is a global defect in proximal tubular  function with resultant urinary losses of the filtered load that would normally  be reabsorbed[3]. Children with Fanconi syndrome typically present with failure to  thrive.</p>
  <p>As  stated previously, urinary concentration occurs in the collecting ducts in the presence  of, and renal response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). The concentration  gradient that allows for concentrating the urine is set up in the loop of  Henle, which first dilutes urine. Urine can be diluted to ~50 mOsm/kg and  concentrated to ~1200 mOsm/kg. Full concentrating ability takes several months  to develop, and a typical full-term neonate can only concentrate their urine to  ~500 mOsm/kg. This concentrating defect of infancy is a result of an immature  counter current multiplier as well as relative tissue insensitivity to ADH[4]. </p>
  <p><img src="/2017/renalphys04.jpg" width="290" height="183"></p>
  <p>In general, if 1) serum electrolytes  (sodium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, bicarbonate) are within normal limits,  2) the urinalysis indicates that the child can concentrate or dilute their  urine, and 3) there is no tubular wasting of glucose or amino acids/protein,  then tubular function can be assessed as normal. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Acute  Kidney Injury</strong><br>
    Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to a  sudden decrease in glomerular filtration rate. AKI is typically reversible,  however there is a growing appreciation that AKI can lead to chronic kidney  disease (CKD). There are several staging classifications of AKI[5] such as the p-RIFLE criteria, which stratifies AKI in children  between &ldquo;Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss and End-Stage.&rdquo; The RIFLE criteria are  based upon urine output and rise in serum creatinine[6]. </p>
  <p>In the setting of AKI, it is important to  understand that a rise in creatinine typically appears only after significant  renal dysfunction has begun, and often several days following the initial  insult - well into the process of kidney injury. </p>
  <p>A typical starting point to determine the  etiology of AKI includes an assessment of prerenal, intrinsic renal, or  obstructive processes. Obstruction can be ruled out via imaging, typically via  renal and bladder ultrasound. Prerenal and intrinsic etiologies of kidney  injury will be discussed herein. </p>
  <p><u>Prerenal azotemia</u> refers to a decrease in GFR secondary to poor renal perfusion,  often in the setting dehydration or volume loss. Patients who are prerenal will  often exhibit oliguria (urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hr in children, &lt;500  mL/day in adults) and will demonstrate signs and symptoms of dehydration  (tachycardia, dry mucus membranes, hypotension, increased skin turgor).  Assessment of a urinary fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) will be very low  (&lt;1%) (<strong>Table 1</strong>), indicating that  the renal tubules are appropriately reabsorbing sodium. Blood urea nitrogen  (BUN) is usually elevated in prerenal azotemia. This is a result of an increase  in reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule which results in a passive  reabsorption of both water and urea nitrogen. Thus, the patient&rsquo;s serum BUN to  creatinine ratio will be elevated in prerenal azotemia. The treatment of  prerenal azotemia is intravascular volume repletion, typically via normal  saline boluses. After attaining euvolemia, it is important not to continue to  bolus with excessive fluids, as prerenal azotemia can lead to acute tubular  necrosis (see below) if the injury is long-standing, and in such cases, the  patient may not be able to make urine. In this case, excessive fluid  resuscitation can lead to hypervolemia with resultant hypertension, edema, and  respiratory distress. </p>
  <p><u>Intrinsic renal failure</u> refers to AKI that is not secondary to prerenal or obstructive  causes. It is most helpful to refer to the construct of the nephron when  considering intrinsic AKI as this correlates with the various etiologies: 1)  vascular causes; 2) glomerulonephritis; 3) acute tubular necrosis; and 4) acute  interstitial nephritis. </p>
  <p>1. <strong>Vascular</strong> causes of AKI are quite common and include any pertubation in blood flow to the  kidney &ndash; most commonly secondary to medications such as NSAIDs or  cyclosporine/tacrolimus, which cause vasconstriction of the afferent  arterioles, or ACE-inhibitors/ARBs such as lisinopril, which cause vasodilation  of the efferent arterioles[7]. For  this reason, it is critical to remember that NSAIDs, including ketorolac and  ibuprofen are completely contraindicated in any patient who is dehydrated, see <strong>Figure 3</strong>[8].<strong></strong><br>
    Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) such as  the hemolytic uremic syndrome can also be classified as a vascular cause of  AKI. In TMA, platelet rich thrombi form in the capillary loops of the  glomeruli, leading to a decrease in GFR. </p>
  <p><img src="/2017/renalphys05.jpg" width="580" height="298"></p>
  <p>of the urine sediment showing red blood  cell casts. The hallmarks of acute glomerulonephritis include hypertension,  edema and AKI. The differential diagnosis of glomerulonephritis can be divided  into two main categories based on serum complement levels &ndash; hypocomplementemic  or normocomplementemic. Hypocomplementic GNs include post-infectious GN,  systemic lupus erythematosis, and membranoproliferative GN. Normocomplementemic  GNs include IgA nephropathy, Alport&rsquo;s syndrome, and the ANCA vasculitides. </p>
  <p>Treatment of acute GN depends on the  underlying cause, and other than in the self-resolving 2. <strong>Glomerulonephritis (GN&rsquo;s)</strong> can typically be diagnosed quite readily  with evaluation illness of post-infectious GN, most GNs require treatment with  immunosuppressive therapy. </p>
  <p>3. <strong>Acute  tubular necrosis (ATN)</strong> is the most common cause of AKI. ATN is usually  caused either by ischemia-reperfusion injury, or exposure to nephrotoxic  medications. Patients with ATN are typically oliguric and their urine sediment  may demonstrate muddy brown or granular casts. In contrast to prerenal  azotemia, patients with ATN have a FENa &gt;1% (<strong>Table 1</strong>). </p>
  <p><img src="/2017/renalphys06.jpg" width="397" height="299"></p>
  <p>have a FENa &gt;1% (<strong>Table 1</strong>). Treatment of ATN includes renal rest &ndash; maintaining euvolemia  and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. In oliguric patients, strict  attention to fluid balance is necessary to maintain euvolemia. Recovery from  ATN may take days to weeks, and often the oliguria transitions to polyuria with  a persistently elevated serum creatinine. When the patient becomes polyuric, it  is critical to maintain adequate hydration. Until the renal tubules recover,  the patient is unlikely to be able to concentrate their urine, and as such they  are at risk for developing prerenal azotemia with a potential secondary renal  hit if intake is not increased to keep up with output. </p>
  <p>A good rule of thumb when dealing with such  patients is to obtain daily weights, strict in&rsquo;s and out&rsquo;s and to maintain the  euvolemic patient on 1/3 x their maintenance fluid plus 1:1 replacement of  urine output. The 1/3 x maintenance approximates the patient&rsquo;s insensible fluid  losses, while the replacement of urine output will work to maintain euvolemia  in both oliguric and polyuric patients. In patients who are npo, typical fluids  can be 5% dextrose 0.45% normal saline<a name="_GoBack"></a>, however serum  electrolytes should be followed closely. Polyuric patients may need addition of  potassium to their intravenous fluids. Patients who have loose stools may need  additional repletion for stool losses, including the addition of bicarbonate to  the fluids. </p>
  <p>4. <strong>Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)</strong> is  an underappreciated cause of AKI. AIN is often triggered by a reaction to an offending  medication and is sometimes referred to as allergic interstitial nephritis. AIN  may also be triggered by a viral infection, however most causes of AIN are  idiopathic. While historically, urine was often sent for evaluation of  eosinophils, eosinophiluria is neither sensitive nor specific for diagnosing  AIN. As such, AIN can be diagnosed clinically in the setting of a patient with  non-oliguric AKI with a bland urine sediment. Treatment of AIN includes  cessation of the offending medication when clinically possible. AIN can also be  treated with steroids, however, if the cause is medication-related, kidney  injury may return once the steroids are discontinued. A rare but associated  disease is tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU)[9]. These patients have both AIN and uveitis. TINU is often responsive  to steroids, however, the uveitis requires ophthalmogic evaluation and  treatment separate and in addition to renal evaluation and treatment. </p>
  <p><strong>Clinical  pearl:</strong> Patients with an intra-abdominal urinary  leak can inappropriately be diagnosed with AKI. In these patients, their serum  creatinine rises secondary to reabsorption of urine creatinine across the  peritoneal membrane with a resultant rise in serum creatinine. In this case,  serum creatinine no longer reflects renal filtration. The diagnosis should be  suspected in any patient with new development of ascites in the setting of a  rising creatinine, who is at risk for urinary leak (i.e. recent surgical  procedure). </p>
  <p><u><strong>Indications for dialysis</strong></u><strong>:</strong><br>
There is no current treatment for AKI other  than supportive care. Renal replacement therapy may be required if optimal  medical management does not suffice. Indications for initiating acute dialysis  include volume overload, electrolyte derangements, metabolic acidosis or  uremia. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Chronic  Kidney Disease</strong><br>
    Chronic kidney disease (CKD) refers to  either laboratory or radiographic evidence of kidney disease that progresses  beyond 3 months. There are five stages of CKD, based on estimated glomerular filtration  rate (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). In children with  CKD, a modified version of the Schwartz equation, known as the &ldquo;Bedside CKiD  Equation&rdquo; is used to estimate their GFR[1, 10].  Unlike adult patients who are often followed by their primary care provider throughout  the early stages of CKD, all children with CKD should be followed by a pediatric  nephrologist for subspecialty care[11]. Particular attention is paid to the growth and development of children  with CKD. The frequency of nephrology follow-up correlates with the stage of  CKD. Of note, GFR reaches its max at around 2 years of age, making it  impossible to stage CKD in children less than 2 years of age accurately.</p>
  <p><img src="/2017/renalphys07.jpg" width="368" height="293"></p>
  <p><strong>Management  of Chronic Kidney Disease</strong><br>
Unfortunately, there is no cure for CKD.  However, early referral to a pediatric nephrologist can help with management of  co-morbidities and delay progression of disease. Routine CKD management  includes assessment of staging, blood pressure control, as well as monitoring  for anemia, growth delay, and metabolic bone disease. </p>
  <p><u>Blood pressure control</u>: Tight blood control to the 50th% for age, sex and  percentile height has been shown to delay progression of CKD[12].  ACE-inhibitors and ARBs are often the preferred agent to control blood pressure  as they also protect against glomerular hyperfiltration. For this reason,  however, they are contraindicated in patients with borderline stage IV and V  GFR or in patients who tend to have hyperkalemia. </p>
  <p><u>Anemia of chronic kidney disease</u>: Children with CKD have several reasons to be anemic &ndash; including  epogen deficiency and increased hepcidin levels which leads to poor utilization  of iron stores[13]. Patients with CKD should have routine CBC&rsquo;s to monitor for the  development of anemia. If and when they become anemic, iron stores should be  checked and normalized. Patients who remain anemic despite adequate iron stores  should be started on erythropoiesis stimulating agents such as epoetin alfa or  darbopoetin alfa[11]. </p>
  <p><u>Metabolic bone disease (MBD)</u>: Formerly referred to as secondary hyperparathyroidism, metabolic  bone disease encompasses not only secondary hyperparathyroidism, but also bone  mineralization and vascular calcifications. MBD is often the most challenging  aspect in managing children with CKD, and is unfortunately the reason for a  significant amount of morbidity and mortality in our pediatric patients with  CKD. MBD leads to increased cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death  in patients with CKD. Indeed, a pediatric patient with end stage renal disease  has the cardiovascular risks of a patient in their 70&rsquo;s[14]. Management includes maintaining adequate stores of 25-hydroxy vitamin  D, maintaining normocalcemia and normal serum phosphorus levels, and  supplementation of active 1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D[15, 16]. It  is often quite difficult for patients to comply with the prescribed phosphorus  binders which are taken with meals, and often cause gagging and discomfort.  This is particularly difficult in young children, with whom mealtime can  already be quite challenging. </p>
  <p><u>Growth</u>:  Children with CKD often have difficulty with growth and development. A  multidisciplinary team including a renal dietician is critical for proper  monitoring of nutritional intake and growth. Unlike adults with CKD, children  do not have a reduced protein limit, as they require protein for growth. We  therefore recommend children with CKD obtain the recommended daily allowance of  protein. Linear growth is particularly challenging because of a relative tissue  insensitivity to growth hormone. Infants and toddlers with CKD often require  gastrostomy tubes for either medication administration and/or supplemental  formula feeds. Special renal formulas that support growth and nutrition while  limiting potassium and phosphorus are often required. Supplemental growth  hormone is indicated in patients not growing well linearly despite adequate  caloric intake. Unfortunately, many families decline growth hormone treatment  in order to save their child a daily injection, however quality of life studies  have demonstrated that adult height positively correlates with quality of life[17, 18]. </p>
  <p><strong>Renal  replacement therapy (RRT)</strong><br>
    Children who are progressing to stage V CKD  require evaluation for renal replacement therapy. RRT can be in the form of  either peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD), or renal transplantation.  For patients who have a potential living donor, pre-emptive transplantation may  be a suitable and often desirable option. Evaluation of a living donor make  take several months, so such a preemptive transplantation should begin while  the patient is still in stage IV CKD. Similarly, introducing the concepts of  dialysis and transplantation at an earlier stage, such as stage III often  benefits the family and patient so they can begin to think about dialysis  modalities versus preemptive transplantation. </p>
  <p>The term &lsquo;dialysis&rsquo; refers to two separate  mechanisms: 1) diffusion of solutes across a semipermeable membrane, and 2)  removal of fluid via ultrafiltration. </p>
  <p><u>Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)</u>:<u></u><br>
    In peritoneal dialysis, dialysate is placed  in the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal membrane acts as the semipermeable  membrane and allows solutes to flow across and down their concentration  gradient. Ultrafiltration is controlled via the addition of dextrose to the  dialysate fluid. By increasing the dextrose concentration to the dialysate, the  osmotic gradient increases, thereby pulling more fluid from the patient into  the peritoneal cavity. The fluid is then drained from the peritoneum. Most  pediatric patients undergo home PD at night while they are asleep. In this way,  they undergo several cycles, typically anywhere from 6-12 cycles. The PD  prescription therefore includes the fill volume, dwell time, and dialysate to  be used (including the dextrose concentration). The additional volume that is  drained during each cycle drain is tallied and the total accumulated over the  treatment is referred to as the ultrafiltrate (UF) volume. Of note, patients  may retain fluid during PD and this typically indicates they might have been  hypovolemic at the initiation of the treatment. Home PD requires extensive  training of the caregivers with frequent communication with their nephrology  center. Caregivers are expected to keep daily logs of pre- and post- treatment  weights, blood pressures, dialysate used and UF obtained. Many patients have a  sliding scale prescription such that the dextrose concentration can be adjusted  based on their pre-dialysis weight and blood pressure. </p>
  <p>Peritonitis is the main risk in patients  who undergo PD. Caregivers are taught to recognize the signs and symptoms of  peritonitis and are also trained to obtain a peritoneal effluent for cell count  and culture prior to initiating intraperitoneal antibiotics. PD patients on  antibiotics should always receive anti-fungal prophylaxis to prevent fungal  peritonitis. Fungal peritonitis is both difficult to diagnosis as well as  treat, and unfortunately requires removal of the PD catheter and has a high  risk of scarring the peritoneal membrane. </p>
  <p>Membrane failure can result from fungal  peritonitis, recurrent bacterial peritonitis, or may be a result of  glycosylation of the membrane from prolonged exposure to the dextrose in the  dialysate. Routine peritoneal membrane tests are performed by their  nephrologist to assess membrane characteristics and to help adjust PD orders  over time. </p>
  <p><u>Hemodialysis (HD)</u>:<br>
    In hemodialysis, the patient&rsquo;s blood is  circulated thru a dialysis machine containing an HD filter. Most filters are  now hollow-fiber capillary membranes. Each fiber is hollow and allows blood to  flow thru the tube, in countercurrent to dialysate flowing around the fibers. This  design allows for a large surface area where-in the fibers are the  semi-permeable membrane that allow for flow of solutes across the membrane and  down their concentration gradient. UF is attained via negative pressure applied  by the dialysis machine. The UF rate is limited by patient size, blood pressure  and symptoms. Dialysis access can be challenging in pediatric patients. Often,  fistula access is limited by patient size and vasculature. As a result, many  pediatric patients have the additional risk of central line access, known to  have an increased risk of infection above fistulas and grafts[11]. </p>
  <p>The choice of dialysis modality is made  based on a combination of the child&rsquo;s current medical status, underlying  disease, family support and often, geographic location (i.e. distance from a  hemodialysis center that will treat children). Past episodes of peritonitis or  surgical procedures that have left adhesions may limit the option to pursue  peritoneal dialysis. Certainly, peritoneal dialysis requires more social  stability as well as time, energy and commitment from the child&rsquo;s caregivers.  Despite these additional responsibilities, PD is often a preferred choice as it  allows the child to continue to go to school. Alternatively, hemodialysis (HD)  is a good alternative for patients who have either failed PD, or who&rsquo;s family  may be unable to provide PD at home. </p>
  <p>Regardless of the dialysis modality chosen,  the goal of every pediatric nephrology program is to successfully tranplant  their pediatric patients with ESRD. The life expectancy of children with ESRD  on dialysis is 50 years shorter than healthy age-matched cohorts, compared to  15 years shorter following transplantation[14]. Transplantation evaluation includes psychosocial evaluation and at  times, transplantation is delayed or put on hold if the child is not interested  or is deemed to be a poor candidate based on non-compliance with prescribed  therapies. </p>
