  <p>Many are familiar with the often quoted statement of Thomas Watson,  Chairman of IBM who in 1943 stated that &ldquo;I think there is a world market for  maybe five computers&rdquo;.&nbsp; Less well known  but equally&nbsp; inaccurate is Bloomfield&rsquo;s  declaration in 1956 that &ldquo;Owing to the relatively small number of affected  children it is unprofitable to make a more detailed study of day wetting&rdquo;. </p>
  <p>Daytime wetting disorders are largely the result of how a child is  &lsquo;built&rsquo; - anatomical abnormalities, how they are &lsquo;wired&rsquo; - neurological  abnormalities or how they use what they have.&nbsp;  It is this latter group of functional voiding disorders that this chapter  will focus on.</p>

  <p>According to the International Children&rsquo;s Continence Society  Dysfunctional Voiding is a specific subtype of daytime voiding abnormality  (1).&nbsp; It is the result of regular  inappropriate contraction of the urethral sphincter during micturition.&nbsp; As such it is not strictly speaking a daytime  wetting disorder, though it may be associated with urinary incontinence. The  ICCS defined daytime lower urinary tract conditions may be divided into  abnormalities of either of the two primary bladder functions,  storage or elimination (see Table 1).&nbsp;  There is however considerable overlap between these conditions and  grouping patients into one category is even more complex than with enuresis.&nbsp; Patients may have symptoms of more than one  sub-type&nbsp; (e.g. overactive bladder and  dysfunctional voiding) or may evolve from one category to another.&nbsp; Children may display symptoms from more than  one sub-type either synchronously (e.g. overactive bladder and dysfunctional  voiding) or metachronously, progressing from predominantly one sub-type to  another (e.g. overactive bladder thru&rsquo; voiding postponement to under-active  bladder.<br>

  <p>Until the publication in 1998 and the subsequent revision in 2006 of  standardized terminology for lower urinary tract dysfunction there was  sufficient variability in the definition of incontinence in children to  preclude meaningful comparison and evaluation.&nbsp;  Various authors placed differing levels of emphasis on the severity,  frequency or duration of the incontinence episodes.&nbsp; Cultural diversity, research methodology and  response rates&nbsp; to population  questionnaires have further confounded prevalence rates. What is evident from  these studies is 1) a geographical variation (probably the result of a lower  threshold for reporting, coupled with better documentation); 2) a slightly  higher prevalence among girls, especially as they get older; and 3) a reduction  in prevalence with increasing age (see Table 2).</p>
  <p>In order to have an understanding of the pathophysiology of voiding  dysfunction it is first necessary to understand the complexities that underlie  lower urinary tract function.&nbsp; <br>

  <p>As discussed in the chapter on Nocturnal Enuresis some genetic  predisposition to enuresis has been demonstrated.&nbsp; By contrast the genetics and heritability of  daytime urinary incontinence have not been extensively studied.&nbsp; This is explained in part by the diversity of  etiologies and the heterogeneous nature of the patient population.&nbsp; However evidence continues to emerge  illustrating the multi-factorial etiology of voiding dysfunction.&nbsp; The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and  Children (ALSPAC), which is an on-going population study following,  prospectively, a birth cohort of almost 14,000.&nbsp;  In a report on 8,230 children the prevalence of daytime urinary  incontinence was 7.8%, of which 6.8% had infrequent (&lt; 2 episodes/week)  wetting and 1% wet twice a week of more frequently (1).&nbsp; The odds ratio of a child with a maternal  history of daytime incontinence herself as a child developing infrequent urinary  incontinence was 2.64 and 5.47 if the father had suffered from daytime urinary  incontinence.&nbsp; The odds ratios were even  greater in children with severe enuresis reaching 3.28 with a maternal history  and 10.1 if the father had a history of childhood enuresis.&nbsp; Further complicating efforts to identify  genetic associations is the heterogeneous nature of the various sub-types of  daytime urinary incontinence e.g. dysfunctional voiding, urge syndrome, giggle  incontinence, polakiuria etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; That  voiding dysfunction may have a congenital or inherited predisposition is  supported by the finding of a loss of function mutation in the heparanase 2  gene in patients with Urofacial (Ochoa) Syndrome(2).&nbsp; Originally described by Elejalde in 1979 but  called after Dr. Bernardo Ochoa who contributed 36 patents with non-neuropathic  neuropathic bladder and &lsquo;inversion&rsquo; of facial features or a characteristic  facial grimace when smiling (<a href="http://omim.org/entry/236730">http://omim.org/entry/236730</a>).&nbsp; Affected patients often present prenatally or  in early childhood (before the age of toilet-training) suggesting a congenital  rather than an acquired pathogenesis.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Physiology</u></strong></p>
  <p>Normal bladder functions of urine storage without leakage and  volitional emptying are the result of complex interactions between the bladder,  the somatic, autonomic and central nervous systems.&nbsp; The seemingly simple and unique ability of  the bladder to accommodate increasing volumes of urine at low pressures is the  result of rather complex interactions between the smooth muscle cells and  extracellular matrix of the bladder wall(3).&nbsp;  The extracellular matrix rather than merely being a scaffold for the  cells of the bladder wall is continually being remodeled in reaction to  stresses and strains placed upon it in a process referred to as &lsquo;dynamic reciprocity&rsquo;.&nbsp; As well as collagens, elastins, laminins and  integrins the extracellular matrix is awash with bioactive substances such as  Matrix Metalloproteases and a host of growth factors from VEGF to EGF and  TGF(4).&nbsp; The amount&nbsp; of collagen in the bladder wall is  considerable with more than a third of the dry bladder weight being  collagen.&nbsp; Though some of the collagen  can be found with the muscle bundles the majority of collagen in the bladder  wall is located outside of the muscle bundles.&nbsp;  The ability of the bladder to hold reasonable quantities of urine at a  low pressure is a reflection of its compliance.&nbsp;  The compliance of the bladder has both active (muscle) and passive  (collagen etc) components.&nbsp; It has been  demonstrated that the&nbsp; inner mucosal  layer of the bladder has the capacity to expand with little or no resistance  due at least in part to the presence and composition of collagen contained  within.&nbsp; The outer detrusor layer serves  to limit this distention in an active manner (5).&nbsp; The result is a distensible bladder that  usually stores urine at a pressure of less than 10-15cm H20 until  the bladder reaches its capacity.&nbsp; There  is a correlation between bladder compliance and the amounts of Collagen types I  and III. Outlet obstruction is associated with &nbsp;increased deposition of collagen type III  which in turn induces muscle hypertrophy resulting in bladder wall thickening  and reduced compliance (3).</p>
  <p>A detailed discussion of bladder neurophysiology is beyond the scope  of this chapter.&nbsp; In its simplest form  the bladder has three sources of neurological input (6).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Parasympathetic efferent nerves, which promote bladder emptying by  inducing detrusor muscle contraction, and bladder outlet relaxation, exit the  spinal canal between S2 and S4 and travel to the bladder in the Pelvic nerve.</li>
    <li>Sympathetic efferent nerves, which inhibit detrusor contraction and  stimulate urethral smooth muscle contraction to promote continence, exit the  thoracolumbar spinal cord between T10 and L2 and travel to the bladder in the  Hypogastric nerve.</li>
    <li>Somatic efferent nerves, whose cell bodies are located in Onuf&rsquo;s  nucleus along the lateral border of the ventral grey matter of the spinal cord,  exit at S2 to S4 and travel to the external urethral sphincter in the Pudendal  nerve.&nbsp; </li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are two principal types of afferent fibre within the bladder  and are principally found in a sub-urothelial plexus.</p>
  <ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Myelinated Ad fibers which respond to bladder distention.</li>
    <li>Unmyelinated C fibers, largely inactive in normal bladders but  become activated in pathological conditions such as inflammation etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Higher, supra-spinal neurological control is mediated by the Pontine  Micturition Centre(PMC) or Barrington&rsquo;s Nucleus which co-ordinates detrusor  contraction and sphincter relaxation in response to bladder sensory input  ascending thru the peri-aqueductal grey matter, thalamus and hypothalamus.&nbsp; Conscious voiding control originates in the  Anterior Cingulate Gyrus and is also coordinated via the PMC.</p>
  <p>Acting via a spinal reflex pathway bladder filling detected by Ad  fiber initiates sympathetic activation of the muscles of the bladder neck and  proximal urethra via a- adrenergic receptors and relaxation of the detrusor  muscle via b-adrenergic receptors.&nbsp; It  also triggers somatic activation of the external urethral sphincter.&nbsp; Voiding is initiated in the cerebral cortex  and begins with relaxation of the external urethral sphincter together with  inhibition of sympathetic activity and para-sympatheticly induced detrusor  contraction.</p>
  <p>The primary neurotransmitter involved in micturition control is  Acetylcholine which acts on two different receptors - nicotinic and  muscarinic.&nbsp; Nicotinic receptors have  little if any role in control of micturition.&nbsp;  There are five muscarinic receptor subtypes, M1 to M5, of which subtypes  M2 and M3 are the most prevalent in the bladder. M2 receptors (70%) are  predominant but it is M3 that are largely responsible for detrusor contraction.</p>
  <p>All of these structures are present at birth but in common with most  volitional neuromuscular functions in human neonates are not functionally  developed at birth.&nbsp; The rate of  acquisition of urine control has been determined by a number of studies but the  most recent and relevant is by Sillen <em>et  al</em> who in a series of publications has prospectively studied the continence  rates in children from birth of preterm infants to 6 years old (7-9).&nbsp; They found that in a western culture where  toilet training is driven by the sensory awareness of the child that perception  of bladder fullness was reported by 31%, 79% and 100% of children aged 2, 3 and  4 years respectively.&nbsp; The median age of  attaining daytime dryness was 3.5 years and all but one child was dry by night  within 10 months of being dry day.&nbsp; There  is evidence that earlier initiation of toilet training is associated with  earlier completion but it does take longer (10).</p>
  <p>Further evidence of the relative immaturity of the control of  micturition at birth is reflected in incomplete bladder emptying/interrupted  voiding due to presumed detrusor-sphincter dysco-ordination.&nbsp; They noted interrupted voiding in fetuses  based on repeated antenatal ultrasonography, 58% of preterm infants, 33% of  term infants, 25% of 1 year olds and 3% of children prior to  toilet-training.&nbsp; This dysco-ordination  has been demonstrated urodynamically by this group and others (11).</p>
  <p>That this age of achieving dryness is driven primarily by  societo-cultural norms is supported by the increasing age at which it is  attained and by the significantly earlier age of dryness in different cultures  for example the Digo people of East Africa whose infants are dry by day and  night by the age of 5-6 months (12).&nbsp;  Similarly early age at toilet training has been demonstrated in  Vietnamese children (13).&nbsp; This cultural  difference is not due to inherited or genetic differences in maturation of the  central nervous system as the technique has been successfully applied to an italian  infant (14).&nbsp; We also capitalize on this  ability to impose learned cortical control on lower urinary tract function in  older children when we apply biofeedback training methods&nbsp; to treat children with continence issues.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Pathophysiology</u></strong></p>
  <p>To try and define the pathophysiology or etiology of pediatric  dysfunctional voiding or other daytime wetting disorders is difficult given the  varied nature of presentation and classification.&nbsp; According to the ICCS incontinence, the  uncontrollable leakage of urine can be either continuous or intermittent (1).&nbsp; Continuous incontinence is almost always due  to an anatomical abnormality and will not be discussed further in this  chapter.&nbsp; Strictly speaking the term  intermittent incontinence, the day or nighttime loss of discrete amounts of  urine, is not applied until after the age of 5 years however if the child has  previously been dry for a period of 6 months or more investigation and  intervention does not need to be delayed.&nbsp;  Nighttime intermittent incontinence is addressed in the chapter on  nocturnal enuresis.&nbsp; There is a great  deal of overlap between the daytime presentation of incontinence with  occasional progression from one to another.&nbsp;  For clarity and to facilitate comparison of published articles/series  the ICCS strongly advocates greater emphasis on the accurate description of  patient symptomatology using their prescribed terminology rather than  attempting to pigeon-hole patients into specific sub-groups.&nbsp; That said there are some specific groups that  can be reasonably accurately defined:</p>
  <p><strong><u>Pollakiuria or Extraordinary  daytime urinary frequency</u></strong>.</p>
  <p>This term refers to children who present with frequent small volume  voids during the daytime.&nbsp; The ICCS  definition mandates that they void at least hourly, however most case void much  more frequently that that (1,15).&nbsp; A  unique pathognomic feature is the absence of any nocturnal polyuria.&nbsp; The pathogenesis is not understood.&nbsp; Dietary intake of bladder irritants,  psychosocial or emotional stress and even climatic factors have all been  implicated.</p>
  <p>The absence of any clear precipitating of provoking factors is  indicated by the paucity of successful treatment modalities.&nbsp; The cornerstone of treatment is reassurance  that the condition is self limiting, lasting from a few days to rarely a few  years but on average 6 months and recurrence is rare.&nbsp; For the 50% who have an identified  psychosocial or emotional stress counseling to address the underlying stressful  event and the natural history of the condition is all that is needed.&nbsp; Clearly management should include the exclusion  of known dietary triggers such as caffeinated soft drinks, acidic fruit juices,  drinks with a high oxalate of calcium content.&nbsp;  There is no ideal drug therapy but treating with anticholinergics such  as Oxybutynin has some empirical merit for refractory or prolonged cases.&nbsp; For some Pelvic Floor Biofeedback has been  successful but remains to be tested in a randomized trial to distinguish  benefit from spontaneous resolution.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Giggle Incontinence or  Enuresis Risoria</u></strong></p>
  <p>Giggle incontinence is again a very specific condition where a  patient, usually female, otherwise lacking any lower urinary tract symptoms  suffers complete bladder emptying during or immediately after laughing. The  ICCS places importance on distinguishing genuine isolated giggle incontinence from  laughter provoked detrusor overactivity (this latter patient group have on  close investigation other lower urinary tract dysfunction) (1).&nbsp; The frequently large volume of the  incontinent episode provoked by laughter is the defining feature for which no cause  has as yet been identified.</p>
  <p>Analogies and comparison with cataplexy have been made.&nbsp; Cataplexy is a crucial component of the  Narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, abnormal  REM sleep, hypnagogic hallucinations cataplexy and sleep paralysis (16).&nbsp; Cataplexy is associated with a sudden loss of  striated muscle tone which may be limited to facial or limb muscles but may be  more extensive. It is usually triggered by positive emotions such as laughter -  hence people who fall down laughing!&nbsp;  There is a strong family history in narcolepsy sufferers with an  inherited predisposition.&nbsp; 85-95% of  sufferers carry the HLA DQB1*0602 allele.&nbsp;  Narcolepsy has been shown to be associated with the loss of hypocretin (  a wakefulness-associated neurotransmitter present in CSF) from the  hypothalamus.&nbsp; How this relates to  cataplexy or to giggle incontinence is yet to be elucidated.</p>
  <p>Given the similarities with cataplexy Sher and Reinberg hypothesized  a similar pathogenesis and applied methylphenidate (Ritalin, previously used  for narcolepsy/cataplexy) to refractory children with giggle incontinence to  varying success in all (17).&nbsp; This  success has subsequently been repeated with a larger series of patients <br>
    For patients in whom the Ritalin failed or was not tolerated  treatment focuses on behavioral modifications such as frequent bladder  emptying, avoidance of situations known to provoke laughter (how depressing!!)  and a hope that they will grow out of it which is not likely.&nbsp; Pelvic floor biofeedback therapy has been  proven to be of some benefit.<br>

  <p><strong><u>Vaginal Voiding</u></strong></p>
  <p>This really is a form of psuedo-incontinence rather than true  incontinence as the urine that leaks immediately post-micturition, upon  resuming an upright posture is urine that during micturition has entered the  vagina.&nbsp; It may be associated with labial  adhesions in the younger child, possibly by causing recurring vulvovaginitis  contributing to the persisting adhesions and ongoing vaginal voiding.&nbsp; It more typically presents in older girls who  tend to be overweight and is attributed to poor voiding posture with internal  rotation of the hips and closure of the perineal area. Sitting backwards on the  toilet (facing the cistern) is both diagnostic and therapeutic.&nbsp; In the author&rsquo;s experience compliance with  this treatment strategy is short-lived as it usually requires complete removal  of underwear from one leg.&nbsp; It does  however confirm the diagnosis and emphasizes to the patient the curative nature  of correct posture.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Stress Incontinence</u></strong></p>
  <p>Genuine stress incontinence (of the kind seen in post-partum women)  is exceptionally rare in neurologically and anatomically normal children.&nbsp; Episodes of urinary incontinence may be seen  to be precipitated by exercise in adolescent female athletes.&nbsp; Urinary incontinence, associated with  coughing has been reported in 19-49% of girls increasing to 30-69% of adult  women with cystic fibrosis (18).&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><u>Overactive Bladder,  Urge Syndrome, Urgency-Frequency Syndrome</u></strong></p>
  <p>According to the International Children&rsquo;s Continence Society &ldquo;the  subjective hallmark of overactive bladder is urgency (the sudden and unexpected  experience of an immediate need to void)&rdquo; associated with which may be urinary  incontinence and increased voiding frequency (1).&nbsp; It is probably the most common cause of  urinary incontinence in children and has been known by a number of previous  synonyms including hyperactive bladder, detrusor overactivity or irritable  bladder.&nbsp; It has been estimated that 5 to  7 million American children, 6 years and older are affected with urinary  incontinence, with a peak incidence between the ages of 5 and 7 years  (19).&nbsp; For too long overactive bladder  was viewed as either the result of a delay in maturation of micturition control  or a regression to a childhood pattern, hence the synonym of persistent  infantile bladder.&nbsp; Despite affecting  over 34 million individuals in the USA and an estimated annual cost of $12.6  billion, the pathogenesis of OAB is still not completely understood (20).&nbsp; In adult patients overactive bladder has been  associated with a number of differing etiologies - 1) neurogenic (e.g. Spina  Bifida, Spinal Cord Injury); 2) myogenic (e.g. obstruction, benign prostatic  hyperplasia; 3) inflammatory (e.g. interstitial cystitis, infection); 4)  idiopathic (21).&nbsp; Whilst children may  also be subject to these same predisposing factors the majority (and the focus  of this chapter) will have idiopathic detrusor overactivity or IDO.</p>
  <p>Urgency has been described as the cornerstone symptom of overactive  bladder (22) and in fact is the only symptom that the patient must have to  diagnose overactive bladder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the  pivotal role of urgency in diagnosing overactive bladder it is imperative that  we be able to objectively appreciate, assess and quantify its presence and  severity. &nbsp;Implicit in the definition of  urgency is the understanding that it can be distinguished from normal bladder  sensation of a need to void as the bladder reaches capacity.&nbsp; For some patients however urgency is a  continuous or chronic sensation of a need to void to avert urinary incontinence  rather than a feeling of sudden onset.&nbsp;  Not all episodes of urgency result in incontinence or micturition, in  approximately 50% of cases the patient can&rsquo;t suppress the urge.&nbsp; Distinguishing significant urgency from  &lsquo;normal&rsquo; is further complicated by the discovery on enquiry of an urgent need  to void (&lt;15mins) in 10% of women (22).</p>
  <p>How one assesses urgency is also the subject of much investigation  and debate. The simplest tool is to ask.&nbsp;  However in asking we are exposed to a number of confounding biases  including but not limited to recall bias, previous opinion bias and my own  personal favorite obsequiousness bias (where responses are altered by  respondents in the direction they perceive desired by the investigator) (23).&nbsp; Brubaker, to demonstrate the complexity of  assessing urgency as a symptom, makes an excellent analogy to hunger.&nbsp; The sensory perception of hunger is  heightened by asking about it or in an environment where the subject is exposed  to the sights, sounds and smells of foods.&nbsp;  Similar neurophysiological mechanisms may be at play in the urgency  associated with running water, washing hands or the key in the front door.&nbsp; To circumvent this investigator prompting, a  number of researchers have developed patient activated input devices to record  and grade severity of urgency (without prompting) during and correlated with  urodynamic studies (24,25).&nbsp; Others have  developed and validated an &lsquo;urge scale&rsquo; to measure urgency (26).&nbsp; There are still other subjective (Indevus Urgency  Severity Scale (IUSS); Urgency Perception Score (UPS)) and objective (&lsquo;warning  time&rsquo;&nbsp; - the interval between first  sensation of urgency and voiding; voiding diaries) scoring systems, with the  objective measures having greater reliability, repeatability and less  susceptibility to confusion between urge and normal filling sensations (27).</p>
  <p>Urgency may be centrally or peripherally mediated.&nbsp; That urgency may be centrally mediated is  supported by the &lsquo;latch-key&rsquo; urgency described above.&nbsp; Furthermore the presence of urgency in  patients without demonstrable rise in detrusor pressure and the reduction in  urgency at initiation of micturition, when the detrusor pressure is still  increasing, support a supra-vesical source.&nbsp;  Whether &lsquo;latch-key&rsquo; urgency is the result of a centrally-mediated  release from cortical suppression of a spinal voiding reflex or represents some  form of Pavlovian conditioning is not known (28).&nbsp; Almost all (75-100%) of patients with  supra-pontine lesions and 25% of those with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease have detrusor  over-activity (29).&nbsp; Functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) has greatly enhanced our understanding of cortical  activity during the storage phase of bladder function.&nbsp; In normal healthy subjects afferent signals  from the bladder and urethra are received in the peri-aqueductal grey matter  (PAG) and are relayed via the thalamus to the insula, to register the sensation  of bladder filling.&nbsp; This activity is  monitored by the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) which effectively coordinates the  response to these signals in addition to motor and emotional input, including  input from the pre-frontal cortex where a decision to void or not arises  ultimately resulting in a decision to either relax or maintain inhibition of  the voiding reflex (30). &nbsp;Individuals  with urgency and urge incontinence demonstrate altered brain responses to  bladder filling both at low and high bladder volumes and in response to  detrusor overactivity.&nbsp; They tend to  demonstrate weak responses at low levels of bladder filling, exaggerated  (perhaps learned) responses at large bladder volumes and again weak or  deactivated pre-frontal cortical activity during detrusor overactivity perhaps  explaining the involuntary nature of urge incontinence and the often observed  apparent lack of awareness.</p>
  <p>Peripheral neurological disorders are also associated with detrusor  overactivity as seen in patients with Multiple Sclerosis which is usually  associated with spinal involvement and also seen in patients with spinal cord  injury (29).&nbsp;&nbsp; The complex interaction  between the peripheral nerves and micturition is evidenced in the successful  suppression of detrusor overactivity by sacral nerve root stimulation, dorsal  penile nerve root stimulation and posterior tibial nerve stimulation with  transcutaneous electrical stimulation (31).&nbsp;  Regardless of whether the loss of neurological inhibition is the result  of a central or peripheral neurological disorder, both probably result in  increased afferent activity from sensitization of the normally silent C fibers.&nbsp; This is sometimes referred to as the  neurogenic hypothesis on the origin of lower urinary tract symptoms (32).&nbsp; Alternative, but not necessarily exclusionary  hypotheses are the myogenic and urothelial hypotheses.</p>
  <p>The myogenic hypothesis proposes that a deregulation of normal  detrusor smooth muscle excitability and communication results in uninhibited  bladder contractions.&nbsp; Contrary to  popular belief we know that the normal bladder is not an inert elastic container  that simply accommodates increasing urine volumes during the storage phase of  the micturition cycle. We have known for over 120 years that the bladder during  filling demonstrates autonomous or non-rhythmic contractions that do not result  in micturition (33).&nbsp; The theory behind  these &lsquo;micromotions&lsquo; or micro-contractions was that they both facilitated local  stretching or micro-stretching of the bladder wall and triggered afferent  &lsquo;sensory&lsquo; signals to the higher cortical regions&nbsp; (34).&nbsp;  These localized contractions have been demonstrated in animal models and  in-vitro with human detrusor tissue and have been shown to be a feature of the  smooth muscle cell (related to Ca++ influx) rather than triggered by  neurological input i.e. they still happen in the presence of neurotoxins  (35).&nbsp;&nbsp; How these naturally occurring  and&nbsp; seemingly essential  micro-contractions relate to larger more generalized or widespread detrusor  contractions seen in detrusor overactivity is still being established  especially as the ability of an electrical impulse to spread from detrusor  myocyte to myocyte is diminished relative to other smooth muscles.&nbsp; There are fewer gap junctions between  adjacent detrusor smooth muscle cells than seen in cardiac smooth muscle.&nbsp; However this increased resistance or reduced  conductivity seen in the detrusor is associated with an enhanced local  excitability which may be relevant to that pathophysiology of detrusor  overactivity (35).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The urothelial hypothesis highlights that the urothelium is much  more than a water-proof barrier, in fact it is possibly the most complex  structure in the bladder.&nbsp; The epithelium  itself has a number of unique properties that enable it to fulfill its  role.&nbsp;&nbsp; The spherical shape of the  bladder provides the minimum of surface area to volume of urine during the  storage phase.&nbsp; The innermost layer of  cells, adjacent to the lumen, so-called umbrella cells or facet cells have the  capacity to infold their epithelial surface to provide a mechanism for  stretching with increasing bladder volumes (36).&nbsp; It is relatively impermeable to passive  transport of molecules, whether this is due to the tight junctions between the  umbrella cells or the glycosamino-glycan layer of Uroplakins that sit on top of  the epithelium has not been determined.&nbsp;  Because the urothelium is not absolutely impermeable it has also has  some active transport mechanisms to ensure urothelial cellular homeostasis  (37).&nbsp; The urothelium has an inherent  inertness which serves to protect and preserve it&rsquo;s impermeability.</p>
  <p>As well as its barrier function the urothelium expresses a number of  sensory receptors more typically found on peripheral nerves.&nbsp; These include TRPV1 (transient receptor  potential cation channel subfamily vanilloid member 1).&nbsp; TRPV1 expression has been shown to be  increased in both Idiopathic Detrusor Overactivity and Neurogenic Detrusor  Overactivity.&nbsp; Increased expression of  purinergic receptor subtypes (P2X and P2Y) has also been documented in IDO and  NDO and are thought to be responding in an autocrine or paracrine manner to ATP  released from the urothelium.&nbsp;  Cannabinoid receptors (CB1) have also been found in urothelium, as have  both alpha and beta adrenoreceptors which when stimulated have been shown to  release ATP and NO.&nbsp; All five muscarinic  receptor subtypes have been identified in urothelium with M3 widely  distributed, M1 localizing to the basal cell layer and M2 to the umbrella cells  (32).&nbsp; The urothelium secretes an equally  wide range of bioactive substances such as ATP, NO, ACh, CGRP.&nbsp; ATP is released in response to stretch,  muscarinic and adrenergic receptor stimulation and stimulation of TRPV1.&nbsp; By acting on the nerves and interstitial  cells in the sub-urothelial area ATP is thought to signal bladder fullness,  possibly activating micturition.&nbsp; NO  triggered by the same stimuli appears to have an inhibitory action on the  bladder.&nbsp; This is suggested by the  inhibition of detrusor overactivity in animals treated with NO donors and the  induction of overactivity when subjected to NO scavengers.&nbsp; Urothelial cells have also been shown to  release ACh in response to mechanical or chemical stimulation.&nbsp; No specific role has yet been found for CGRP  in the bladder.</p>
  <p>Beneath the urothelium is the equally functionally important  sub-urothelial layer which contains connective tissue, nerves and blood  vessels.&nbsp; Whilst the most sensitive nerve  endings in the bladder are located in the detrusor muscle and transmit via the  myelinated A delta neurons.&nbsp; The nerve  endings of the unmyelinated C-fibres on the other hand terminate in the  urothelium and lamina propria.&nbsp; Under  normal circumstances C-fibres are thought to only be activated by bladder  distention greater than that which activates A delta fibres.&nbsp; It is thought that C-fibre activation becomes  relevant in pathological conditions and therefore may be more relevant to the  sensation of urgency (38).&nbsp; Many of the  nerves in the lamina propria express receptors for Substance P and CGRP as well  as TRPV1 and P2X receptors. That C-fibres can be stimulated by urothelial  derived neurotransmitters implicates the urothelium directly in the generation  of urgency.&nbsp; Furthermore the lamina  propria contains interstitial cells that form a functional syncytium that may  help to propagate a depolarization wave or localized detrusor contraction in response  to urothelial derived neurotransmitters.&nbsp;  Detrusor overactivity has been linked to increased Gap junction  expression in lamina propria interstitial cells possibly having a role in the  genesis of DO thru enhanced conductivity.&nbsp;  Some of these interstitial cells have recently been shown to have  properties similar to the gut derived Interstitial Cells of Cajal and therefore  capable of spontaneous activation.&nbsp; This  has led to further comparisons with the gastrointestinal neuro-enteric system  suggesting that the nerves and interstitial cells of the urothelium may be  arranged into functional rather than anatomical &lsquo;myovesical&rsquo; plexuses analogous  to the myoenteric plexus of the GI tract (39).&nbsp;  Clearly the urothelium is an active participant rather than an innocent  bystander (40).</p>
  <p>As we have seen here and in the chapter on enuresis our  understanding of the complexity of the neurological and vesical contributions  to bladder function have grown exponentially in recent decades.&nbsp; No longer can we view the bladder as a  muscular bag over which we exercise volitional control.&nbsp; Rather the bladder is a complex sensory organ  capable of responding to a variety of differing stimuli.&nbsp; Where previously it was thought that  conscious bladder sensation arose in a consistent and predictable manner  starting with &lsquo;first sensation of bladder filling&rsquo;, &lsquo;first desire to void&rsquo; and  &lsquo;strong desire to void&rsquo; (41), we now know that the Central nervous system is  constantly being inundated with sensory information, that could be described as  &lsquo;afferent noise&rsquo; (42).&nbsp; Afferent sensory  information from the bladder is continually arriving in the CNS and which  impulses reach consciousness and trigger micturition remains to be  elucidated.&nbsp; The constant &lsquo;streaming&rsquo; of  bladder sensations, though not conscious, are able to be accessed at will to  provide a snapshot of the current state of bladder filling.&nbsp; This necessity to &lsquo;ignore&rsquo; some afferent  output from the bladder, in order to focus on other daytime activities, may  explain some of the features associated with voiding dysfunction such as  impaired sensation of the need to or often of the act of voiding.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Dysfunctional  Voiding, Dysfunctional Eliminations Syndrome, Nonneurogenic Neurogenic Bladder</u></strong></p>
  <p>Dysfunctional voiding, as defined by the ICCS (1), is a term that  can only be applied with either uroflowmetric or urodynamic evidence of  inappropriate sphincteric contraction during micturition resulting in a  staccato urinary stream.&nbsp; It is the  equivalent of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia seen in patients with overt  neuropathy and results from a loss of normal coordination between the detrusor  and external sphincter.&nbsp; As it is a  symptom of the voiding phase it can co-exist with storage phase symptoms such  as overactive bladder.&nbsp; In fact  dysfunctional voiding is often considered to have arisen as a response to urge  incontinence where heightened pelvic floor tone develops to prevent  incontinence and ultimately the loss of adequate relaxation during  micturition.&nbsp; This often leads to  incomplete bladder emptying, high post-void residuals and recurrent urinary  tract infections which then cause bladder inflammation and urgency thus  creating a vicious cycle.&nbsp; An alternative  hypothesis is that dysfunctional voiding is due to psychosocial (as seen in  girls with a history of sexual abuse) or centrally mediated phenomenon (as seen  in children with Ochoa Syndrome or ADHD) (43).&nbsp;  Further confusion arises from the alpha-adrenergic activity of the  centrally acting agents used to treat ADHD which may therefore precipitate or  aggravate dysfunctional voiding.</p>
  <p>The most extreme end of the dysfunctional spectrum is Hinman-Allen  Syndrome or Non-neurogenic Neurogenic Bladder (44).&nbsp; Originally described by Beer in 1915 as  chronic urinary retention in children, type 2C or due to spasticity of the  sphincter without neurologic signs but presumed due to disease of the sacral  cord (45).&nbsp; That Hinman-Allen Syndrome  represents the end-stage of an acquired voiding dysfunction has been called in  to doubt by publications that have identified patients as young as 5 months,  well before the age of toilet training or the acquisition of volitional bladder  control (46).&nbsp; Jayanthi and others have  reported cases diagnosed post-natally but with antenatal features of severe  hydronephrosis suggesting a congenital or pre-natal etiology (47).&nbsp; However we do no from video-urodynamic  studies carried out in asymptomatic, control infants that dyscoordinated and  high pressure voiding is a normal phenomenon.&nbsp;  As with detrusor overactivity our emerging understanding of the varied  pathogenesis of dysfunctional voiding would suggest that there are differing  sub-types that may respond better to differing treatment strategies whether  that be hypnotherapy <em>a-la</em> Hinman for  late onset ? psychogenic/? sexual abuse patients, early vesicostomy for  suspected but unconfirmed antenatal cases or Biofeedback +/- alpha-blockers for  those who present in childhood.&nbsp; One of  the defining features of Hinman-Allen Syndrome is the associated renal  impairment, the origin of which is again probably multifactorial and related to  high intra-vesical pressures, reduced bladder compliance, recurrent urinary  tract infections and vesico-ureteric reflux.</p>
  <p>The association between dysfunctional voiding and vesico-ureteric  reflux is well documented having been first recognized by Lapides in 1970. &nbsp;Of the children enrolled in the International  Reflux Study 18% had dysfunctional voiding with a lower prevalence among those  with spontaneous resolution of their reflux (43).&nbsp; The relationship between VUR and  dysfunctional voiding is a complex one of cause and effect.&nbsp; That VUR may arise as a result of bladder  dysfunction is supported by the reflux seen to develop in patients with  anatomical outlet obstruction such as Posterior Urethral Valves and in  Neurogenic Destrusor Overactivity or Detrusor Sphincter Dyssynergia seen in  patients with Spina Bifida.&nbsp; There are  numerous studies documenting 38-75% prevalence rates of dysfunctional voiding  in children with vesico-ureteric reflux (48).&nbsp;  Successful treatment of dysfunctional voiding with biofeedback or anticholinergic  medication has been associated with resolution of VUR in 37-63% of patients  with a downgrading of the grade of VUR in a further 16-29%. In a recent review  of the literature Sillen was unable to convincingly show evidence of a  significant positive effect on the resolution of VUR following treatment of  dysfunctional voiding.</p>
  <p>The relationship between bowel and bladder dysfunction has been  discussed elsewhere, the association is so well documented that Koff coined the  term Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome.&nbsp;  In fact Koff found that bowel dysfunction (constipation) had an equal if  not more significant impact on the spontaneous resolution of VUR (49).  Dysfunctional elimination syndrome is more common in girls (50) with a peal  incidence between 5-12 years of age (51).&nbsp;&nbsp;  Though there is an association a clear causal relation has not been  demonstrated.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><u>Diagnosis</u></strong></p>
  <p>Patients are usually referred to a Pediatric  Urologist either because of recurrent urinary tract infections or intractable  urinary incontinence - &gt;99% (52).&nbsp;  They have usually been receiving treatment from their family  practitioner and/or Pediatrician (who may or may not have an interest in  incontinence) for a few years prior to eventual referral.&nbsp; The referring doctor is usually requesting  urodynamic investigation to confirm or exclude an occult neurogenic  bladder.&nbsp; The patient/parents, on the  other hand, are usually expecting a &lsquo;miracle&rsquo; cure whether that be surgical or  not.&nbsp; This ever increasing reliance on  diagnostic tests and investigations belies the importance of a detailed and  targeted history and physical examination.&nbsp;  In my experience the initial clinical consultation is often fraught with  parental and patient angst because of the need to start again with a  comprehensive history etc.&nbsp; Initial  questioning should focus on defining the nature of the problem to identify  anatomical causes of incontinence and occult neuropathy.&nbsp; Having excluded these structural causes of  incontinence questioning should them aim to identify the subtype of voiding  dysfunction. </p>
  <p>When taking a history it is important to have a good understanding  of the patient&rsquo;s voiding habits.&nbsp; How  often does he/she void? Three times a day or less is by definition a decreased  daytime frequency or infrequent voider whereas 8 times or more represents  increased frequency (1).&nbsp; How urgently do  they need to void once they feel the need?&nbsp;  In other words can they hold on if they have to e.g. when in the car, at  the movies, during class etc.?&nbsp; When they  void do they do so with a continuous stream with ease or is the stream  intermittent or associated with straining?&nbsp;  Are there any difficulties initiating voiding or is there a sensation of  incomplete emptying?&nbsp; Are they  incontinent of urine?&nbsp; If so to what  extent e.g. damp undies at the end of the day or frequent change of clothing  during the day?&nbsp; Are they continuously  incontinent (suggestive of an anatomical abnormality such as an ectopic ureter  or epispadias) or is it episodic and if so when does it happen and what if  anything provokes it?&nbsp; Does it only occur  immediately after voiding in an overweight teenage girl, suggestive of vaginal  voiding or reflux that then leaks out when she resumes an erect posture?&nbsp; Does it only occur towards the end of the day  in a girl who avoids urinating in school?&nbsp;  Is it only provoked by laughter suggestive of giggle incontinence?&nbsp; Are they aware of these episodes before they  occur, as they occur or only afterwards?&nbsp;  Are they also incontinent or urine during the night?&nbsp; How long has it been happening?&nbsp; Have they ever been dry for a period of 6  months or more - this distinguishes primary from secondary incontinence?&nbsp; Do they have any pain associated with  micturition?&nbsp; Do they practice any  voiding postponement maneuvers (usually the parents are more reliable witnesses  of this) e.g. the &lsquo;pee-pee dance&rsquo;, boys grasping their penis, girls  demonstrating Vincent&rsquo;s curtsy (squatting down on their heel to avert urinary  incontinence, often likened to putting the cork in the bottle but more likely  to work via a spinal reflex suppressing detrusor contraction) (53).&nbsp; For smaller girls it is important to  establish if they can sit on the toilet with their feet supported, use a step  or balance?&nbsp; To where do they take down  their underwear, knees or ankles?&nbsp; For  older girls when voiding outside the home do they sit or try to hover above the  &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; toilet seat?&nbsp; Will they use the  school toilets?</p>
  <p>How often do they open their bowels?&nbsp;  What is the nature of their stool?&nbsp;  The Bristol Stool Form Scale is a very useful visual aid, though most  girls deny looking at their own stool!&nbsp;  Do they pass stool easily or with discomfort and straining?&nbsp; Is there any faecal soiling of their  underwear, and if so to what extent - a small &lsquo;skid&rsquo; mark or enough to require  removal prior to washing?&nbsp; What is the  nature of their fluid intake - volume, frequency and nature of fluid  consumed?&nbsp; Certain fluids such as soft  drinks, dark cordials, teas, coffee etc are more likely to provoke or aggravate  storage symptoms.&nbsp; Children who wet  consciously and subconsciously reduce their fluid intake in order to minimize  the likelihood.&nbsp; The nature of their  dietary fibre intake as it relates to their bowel habit is important in those  children with constipation.</p>

  <p>When enquiring into their past medical history it is important to  ascertain any history of urinary tract infection and to scrutinize this closely  to understand the underlying symptoms that provoked investigation and the  nature and precise detail of specimen acquisition, analysis an  interpretation.&nbsp; It is important to  distinguish between a culture proven UTI and balanitis in boys or  vulvovaginitis in girls.&nbsp; Any  co-morbidities especially of the genitourinary tract or neuro-developmental may  be relevant.&nbsp; Children with ADHD have  significantly higher rates of incontinence and other symptoms of urinary and  bowel dysfunction than the normal population (54).</p>
  <p>Physical examination is usually unhelpful but none the less  essential.&nbsp; It is aimed at detecting or  excluding anatomical abnormalities.&nbsp;  Examination begins with the lower abdomen looking for a palpable and/or  expressible bladder, palpable stool suggestive of constipation and palpation of  the symphysis pubis.&nbsp; It then extends  down to the genitalia looking for labial adhesions, a bifid clitoris and a  uro-genital sinus in girls and meatal stenosis or pathological phimosis in  boys.&nbsp; Skin excoriation or discoloration  from urinary incontinence and faecal or urinary staining of their underpants  may also be seen.&nbsp; The examination  extends posteriorly to the lower back and sacral region looking for signs of  sacral agenesis or stigmata of occult spinal dysraphism such as a vascular  malformation, a cutaneous hairy patch, a sacral sinus or asymmetrical buttock  creases.&nbsp; A brief neurological  examination is an essential part of the physical examination and begins when  the patient walks into the examination room by assessing their gait.&nbsp; Gross lower limb tone and sensation,  asymmetrical calf wasting, unilateral loss of normal plantar arches,  perineal/peri-anal sensation and ano-cutaneous reflex constitute the minimum  neurological examination required.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Investigations</u></strong></p>
  <p>The initial investigation should be urinalysis and urine culture to  exclude a urinary tract infection.&nbsp;  Further baseline investigations may include a plain abdominal film often  referred to as a KUB.&nbsp; This is probably  better referred to as a BUCKS film - B = bladder, U = ureter, C = colon, K =  Kidney and S = spine, the additional benefit being information about the bowels  and the spine for dysraphism.&nbsp; An  ultrasound of the renal tract with assessment of pre- and post-void bladder  volumes will provide information about the upper urinary tract such as the  presence of a Duplex kidney in a girl which may be associated with an ectopic  ureter.&nbsp; At the bladder level, bladder  wall thickening or large post-void residuals are suggestive of dysfunctional  voiding.&nbsp; In a large series of over 1,000  unselected patients with dysfunctional voiding ultrasound was normal in 97%  (52).&nbsp; The exact role of imaging in the  investigation has yet to be determined and must be decided on an individual patient  basis (55).&nbsp; The routine use of other  radiological imaging is generally reserved for patients who present with a  history of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections (52).</p>
  <p>Perhaps the most crucial initial &lsquo;investigation&rsquo; is a detailed  elimination diary. Diaries have been shown to be the most cost effective of all  initial investigations (56).&nbsp; They found  diaries to have 88% sensitivity and 83% specificity for the detection of  detrusor overactivity.&nbsp; The ICCS recommendation  is that a detailed &lsquo;bladder diary&rsquo; be used for initial investigation and that a  less exhaustive &lsquo;frequency-volume chart&rsquo; be used for follow-up.&nbsp; We prefer &lsquo;elimination diary&rsquo; as it also  incorporates a record of bowel function.&nbsp;  A great deal has been written about bladder diaries - over 1463  published studies make reference to or investigated the role of urinary  diaries, varying from &lsquo;Micturition Charts&rsquo; that simply record the times of  micturition, to &lsquo;Frequency/Volume Charts&rsquo; that included voided volumes to  &lsquo;Bladder Diaries&rsquo; that additionally captured information about incontinence  episodes, urgency and fluid intake (57).&nbsp;  Despite this flurry of publication there is still no validated d<img width="420" height="268" src="dysfunc_void_clip_image001_0002.gif" align="left" hspace="16" vspace="16" alt="Text Box: Grade	Definition  0	Convenience (no urge)  1	Mild urge (can hold for more than 1 hour)  2	Moderate urge (can hold for 10-60 mins)  3	Severe urge (can hold for less than 10 mins)  4	Desperate urge (must go immediately)  Table 4 - Urgency Perception Score, Blaivas et al. J Urol 2007; 177: 199-202     ">iary format.&nbsp; The optimal duration of a bladder diary has  yet (and probably will never be) to be determined.&nbsp; Diary durations ranging from 1 -14 days have  been used.&nbsp; Diaries that are too short in  duration have a problem with reliability whereas those that are too long have a  problem with compliance either at commencement (&lsquo;diary despair&rsquo;) or near  completion (&lsquo;diary fatigue&rsquo;). Durations of 4 days have been shown to be as  reliable as 7-day diaries and currently most authors recommend a minimum of 3  days, ideally 4 but 5 if the number of incontinence episodes is important (58).&nbsp; Compliance with data entry and diary  completion is significantly enhanced if an electronic diary rather than a paper  one is used.&nbsp; In a study of adults with  chronic pain required to make diary entires ideally within 30mins and at worst  within 90mins, patient self-reported compliance with paper diary entry was  90-95% whereas actual compliance was 11-20% which compares unfavorably with 95%  actual compliance with an electronic diary (59).&nbsp; Forty percent of patients completing a paper  diary were found to have at least 1 day of &lsquo;hoarding&rsquo; (where the data for for  that was entered retrospectively which renders them far more susceptible to  recall bias than electronic diaries.&nbsp;  Different diary parameters require different diary durations to achieve  reliability (60).&nbsp; One must also be aware  of the placebo effect associated with the completion of a bladder diary and the  inevitable bias that would introduce if the diary was for an extended period.</p>
  <p>A variety of symptom scoring systems have been developed to help  both with patient evaluation both at the time of initial diagnosis and also to  monitor progress both clinically and in the context of drug trials (61-65).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is important that a bladder diary have some form of validated  assessment of urgency (such as the Urgency Severity Score or the Urgency  Perception Score) (66) - see Table 4.&nbsp;  When providing patients with a diary for completion, a detailed  explanation must be provided to patients to ensure adequate completion and to  minimize social desirability and obsequiousness biases.&nbsp; The bladder diary has been shown by Abrams  and Klevmark to be capable of suggesting a clinical diagnosis (see Table 5).</p>

  <p>The next level of investigation involves objective assessment of  urine flow thru&rsquo; the use of uroflowmetry either in isolation or combined with  pelvic floor electromyography.&nbsp; Simple  uroflowmetry alone is useful as a screening tool where (when combined with  ultrasonographic assessment of post-void residual) when repeated can document a  normal flow rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment of post  void residual needs to be made as soon as possible after voiding to reduce the  possibility of pseudo-residuals and residuals consistently greater than 20mls  are to be considered pathological.&nbsp;  Whilst the uroflow apparatus provides detailed analysis of urine flow  such as Qmax - maximum flow rate, Qave - average flow rate, Vt - voiding time,  tQmax - time to maximum flow rate - these are merely mathematical numerical  descriptors of the shape of the urine flow curve and are as such subject to  error and misinterpretation.&nbsp; Most  clinicians place greater emphasis on the shape of the flow curve.&nbsp; There is marked inter- and intra-observer  agreement on the shape of a normal curve but less so in abnormal curves (67),  even when the observers are pediatric urologists (68).&nbsp; However given that the primary purpose of  uroflowmetry is to distinguish those patients who would benefit from more  invasive urodynamic assessment from those who would undergo unnecessary  investigation, it remains a valuable screening tool.</p>
  <p>It is a tool that has been greatly enhanced thru&rsquo; the addition of  pelvic floor electromyography (69).&nbsp; The  addition of EMG allows simultaneous assessment of pelvic floor muscle activity  with assessment of urine flow.&nbsp; Pelvic  floor EMG is most accurately recorded thru&rsquo; the use of specifically designed  barbed needle electrodes, however these are not particularly appealing to adult  let alone pediatric patients.&nbsp; It is much  more common then to use surface patch electrodes which though less targeted  achieve the same end.&nbsp; Glassberg et al.  have used combined uroflow/EMG to stratify children with a variety of lower  urinary tract symptoms into one of 4 urodynamically defined groups (70).<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Dysfunctional Voiding - active pelvic floor EMG during voiding, with  or without detrusor overactivity.</li>
    <li>Idiopathic Detrusor Overactivity Disorder - detrusor overactivity on  urodynamics, with quiet pelvic floor EMG during micturition</li>
    <li>Detrusor Underutilization Disorder - willful infrequent but  otherwise normal voiding</li>
    <li>Primary Bladder Neck Dysfunction</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The same group found that similar classification could be achieved  thru the use of uroflow/EMG. They introduced the concept of EMG lag time&nbsp; - the interval between the start of pelvic  floor relaxation and the start of urine flow, between 2-6 seconds in normal  children.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Dysfunctional Voiding - active pelvic floor EMG during voiding with  or without staccato flow</li>
  </ol>
  <p>2a) Idiopathic Detrusor Overactivity Disorder A - a quiet pelvic  floor during voiding and a shortened lag time (&lt;2secs.)<br>
    2b) Idiopathic Detrusor Overactivity Disorder B - a quiet pelvic  floor with a normal lag time</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Detrusor Underutilization Disorder&nbsp;  - volitionally deferred voiding with expanded bladder capacity but a  quiet pelvic floor</li>
    <li>Primary bladder neck dysfunction - prolonged lag time (&gt;6secs.)  and a depressed, right shifted flow curve with a quiet pelvic floor during  voiding</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Whilst the terminology they use is not strictly in accord with ICCS  recommendations they demonstrate the usefulness of Urolflow/EMG for diagnosing  and directing treatment of children with lower urinary tract symptoms.</p>
  <p>The place of more formal video-urodynamics is still the subject of  debate with some arguing that it has a role and others arguing it is an  unnecessary and extravagant expense.&nbsp;  Glassberg refers to the later group as impressionists as they base their  clinical diagnosis and treatment plan on the key aspects of the history they  deem relevant.&nbsp; This is often augmented  with some non-invasive investigation.&nbsp;  The other extreme they refer to as purists believe all patients require  formal video-urodynamics for an accurate diagnosis.&nbsp; This accuracy comes at an increased cost  (69).&nbsp; The reality is that the majority  of patients are appropriately managed with a less invasive approach.&nbsp; In a large series of 3,500 children with  non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction, 1,000 were selected for video-urodynamics  based on a history of UTI, a small bladder capacity not responding to  urotherapy, repeated dysfunctional uroflowmetry, ultrasononographic  abnormalities and resistance to treatment (71).&nbsp;  They found normal urodynamic studies in 6%, urge syndrome (58%),  dysfunctional voiding (31%) and lazy bladder (4%).&nbsp; What they did not show in that paper was the  impact of urodynamics of patient management or outcome.&nbsp; Others have also reported a high diagnostic  yield from urodynamics in children with non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction  reporting normal (37%), storage phase abnormalities, predominantly DO (42%) and  voiding phase abnormalities in 21% (72).&nbsp;  That said the vast majority of reports do not advocate routine urodynamics  but rather they advocate they be used for those patients who are failing to  respond to therapy&nbsp; (52,73,74).</p>
  <p><strong><u>Non-operative Management</u></strong></p>
  <p>While the treatment of voiding dysfunction should be matched and  tailored to the particular sub-type of lower urinary tract dysfunction that the  patient is afflicted with, there are some initial therapeutic interventions  that are applicable to all.&nbsp; These  measures have collectively termed - Urotherapy.&nbsp;  Initially termed &lsquo;compound therapy&rsquo;&nbsp;  in Scandinavia in the 1980&rsquo;s it included behavioral, cognitive and  physical therapies including some biofeedback.&nbsp;  Nowadays the term urotherapy encompasses patient and family education,  fluid management, optimal bowel management, and possibly pelvic floor muscle  re-education/biofeedback and neuromodulation, essentially the non-surgical and  non-pharmacological measures.&nbsp; Once a  clinical diagnosis has been made the initial and possibly most important step  is to educate the patient and their parents about the nature of the condition  essentially demystifying their problem and removing any culture of blame.&nbsp; Therapy starts with behavioral modifications  based on history, clinical examination, the elimination diary and uroflowmetry  with PVR measurement.&nbsp; For girls initial  advice should focus on voiding posture.&nbsp;  It is important to ensure that young girls are able to sit with their  feet supported (either on the floor or a step).&nbsp;  All girls should sit with their hips abducted opening up the pelvic  floor to optimize urine flow and avoid vaginal voiding.&nbsp; For those with a history of urinary tract  infection appropriate post micturition perineal hygiene should be taught.&nbsp; For those with perineal irritation or  vulvovaginitis additional advice re the substitution of synthetic underwear  (e.g. polyester) with more breathable fabrics such as cotton.&nbsp; There is a suspicion that some foods/drinks  may cause perineal irritation similar to those that are implicated in  interstitial cystitis.&nbsp; These include  citrus juices, chocolate, carbonated soft drinks, spicy foods, tomato and  vinegar to name a few (75).</p>
  <p>A frequent recommendation is the exclusion of caffeinated drinks  based on <em>in-vitro</em> evidence of direct  detrusor stimulation by caffeine and urodynamically demonstrated detrusor  overactivity.&nbsp; Following initial  ingestion of caffeine in healthy volunteers there is a demonstrable diuresis to  which subjects seem to become resistant with on-going administration (76).&nbsp; Whether patients with bladder dysfunction  develop the same tolerance has not been investigated. Swithinbank <em>et al</em> found no benefit from dietary  exclusion of caffeine containing drinks on incontinence rates in adult women  with stress or urge incontinence (77). A number of epidemiological studies  looking at over 16,000 adult patients in total, found no correlation between  self-reported caffeine intake and symptoms of incontinence.&nbsp; In the largest prospective study yet looking  at the relationship between caffeine intake and urinary incontinence involving  over 21,000 patients no obvious correlation between caffeine intake and  progression of urinary incontinence could be detected (78).&nbsp; That same group reporting on over 65,000  adults found that high caffeine intake but not low levels were associated with  incontinence (79).&nbsp; Despite this there  are studies reporting a reduction in incontinence episodes in symptomatic  adults following a reduction in caffeine intake (80).&nbsp; Hence a restriction or elimination of  caffeinated drinks remains a widespread recommendation.</p>
  <p>There is some evidence in adult patients with obesity and urinary  incontinence of a reduction in episodes of incontinence equivalent to that seen  with some behavioral or pharmacological therapies.&nbsp; Obese women, with a BMI of 25-45Kg/m2,  who lost between 5-10% body weight had at least a 50% reduction in frequency of  incontinence episodes (81).</p>
  <p>The elimination diary will identify those children who are  infrequent voiders and may benefit from a timed voiding regimen to encourage  them to void a minimum of 5 times per day and ideally 7.&nbsp; For young children a parent can remind them  out of school and they can use the school schedule to remember during the  school day.&nbsp; Unfortunately many parents  report that these reminders to void often result in conflict with the patient  who does&nbsp; not &lsquo;feel the need&rsquo; to void and  will do so once they finish the activity they are currently involved in.&nbsp; For these a &lsquo;Star Chart&rsquo; reward system  (similar to that used when toilet training) may help to reduce this conflict  and engage the patient.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those  children who are sufficiently motivated and wish to take &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; of their  problem a vibrating watch such as the Malem Vibralite or Wobl watch can be set  to vibrate silently at the appropriate time so their peers remain unaware.&nbsp; Regular timed voiding is also a cornerstone  in the management of children with detrusor overactivity where it can be used  to re-establish good voiding patterns by establishing a minimum frequency of  micturition e.g. 7 times per day, and in addition encouraging them to void at  all other times when they feel the need to.&nbsp;  The addition of a programmable watch has been shown to make a  significant additional contribution to the management of children with daytime  urge incontinence.&nbsp; Compared to a control  group receiving standard Urotherapy the addition of a programmable watch to  remind the patient to void 7 times a day led to a significant reduction of wet  days&nbsp; in 60% which translated into 60%  being continent at a median of 6 months compared to 30% of those who were not  using a watch (82).&nbsp; Micturition  postponement is to be avoided at all times as, rather than encouraging  increased bladder capacity as hoped, it reinforces subconscious suppression of  bladder sensation.&nbsp; There was a period in  the late 70&lsquo;s and 80&lsquo;s when &lsquo;bladder training&rsquo; was advocated by Frewen and  others where patients were encouraged to postpone micturition to prolong  intervals between voids.&nbsp; He reported  that bladder training resulted in 87% subjective and 53% objective improvement  in abnormal urinary symptoms, most interestingly the first to improve was  nocturia (83).&nbsp; However there was a high  relapse rate (84).&nbsp; His assertions that  &lsquo;the deleterious effects on bladder function of frequent and urgent voiding&rdquo;  can become an &ldquo;addictive habit&rdquo; that will then spread to their children thru&rsquo; a  process of mimicry would not have any credibility with our increasing  understanding of bladder function (85).</p>
  <p>The ideal initial inter-void interval can be based on the  elimination diary and gradually increased, in 15 min increments, at fortnightly  intervals in response to successful dry periods.&nbsp; For those patients with dysfunctional voiding  (thickened bladder wall, high post-void residuals, recurrent UTIs, abnormal  uroflowmetry) double or triple voiding (based on ultrasonography) may be  necessary to ensure sufficient bladder emptying, thus minimizing recurrent UTIs  which of course contribute to detrusor overactivity, frequency, urgency and  incomplete emptying thereby perpetuating the cycle.</p>
  <p>The complex interactions between bowel and bladder function underpin  the importance of appropriate and adequate bowel management as an initial step  in the treatment of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Though a  clinical association between bowel and bladder dysfunction has been identified  since 1952, it was not until 1998 that their association was cemented in the  term &lsquo;dysfunctional elimination syndrome&rsquo; (49). Loening-Baucke looking at 234  consecutive patients with functional constipation and encopresis noted a  history of daytime urinary incontinence (29%), nocturnal enuresis (34%) and  UTIs (11%).&nbsp; Successful relief of  constipation in 52% was associated with resolution of daytime urinary  incontinence in 89%, of nocturnal enuresis in 63% and a complete cessation of  UTIs (86).&nbsp; A cornerstone of initial  therapy is to focus on achieving a normal bowel habit.&nbsp; Ideally a good bowel habit is based on  adequate and appropriate dietary fibre and fluid intake.&nbsp; The American Academy of Pediatrics has  recommended that the daily fiber intake of children over 2 years old should be  between age in years + 5gm/day to age +8 gm/day (87).&nbsp; That said in a randomized trial of dietary  fiber supplements from Spain patients with chronic constipation had a daily  fiber intake in excess of age + 5gm/day proving that there is more to the  management of constipation that merely increasing fiber intake (88).&nbsp; Another routine recommendation is to increase  fluid intake (with the intention of both improving stool consistency, by binding  to the increased fiber, and improving urine output.&nbsp; There is however no evidence of a change in  stool consistency in response to increased fluid intake whether that fluid be  hypo-, iso- or hypertonic.&nbsp; All it seems  to affect is the urine output, as the majority of fluid is absorbed high up in  the GI tract (89).&nbsp; Other, frequently  used non-pharmacologic measures to address constipation include exercise,  pre-biotics, probiotics, behavioral therapy (counseling etc) have also not been  shown in clinical trails to have any actual benefit over placebo in either  adults or children (90,91).&nbsp; However most  of the trials that have been carried out have been underpowered and have  focussed on a single aspect of therapy rather than combination.&nbsp; Intuitively additional fibre and fluid should  have a complimentary effect that either alone.&nbsp;  Failure of constipation to resolve with these measures should be  followed up with aggressive administration of laxatives.&nbsp; Once an effective regimen has been  identified, and there is no evidence for the efficacy of one particular  laxative over another,&nbsp; laxative  treatment must be maintained for months and gradually weaned.&nbsp; Up to 20% of patients will be &lsquo;cured&rsquo; by  these steps alone </p>
  <p>The response to these behavioral modifications and the clinical  diagnosis will determine the next therapeutic intervention to be offered.&nbsp; Whereas the above behavioral modifications  can be readily incorporated in the patients daily life their success is  determined by patient motivation and attrition and relapse rates are high.&nbsp; The highest success rates come from those  programs that educate and empower patients and provide intensive support and  on-going back-up (92).&nbsp; Weiner et al reported  improvement of symptoms in 74% at one year, maintained in 59% at 5 years with  simple urotherapy.&nbsp; of those patients 77%  would recommend this treatment to others (93).&nbsp;  Whether the better approach is to introduce each measure individually or  use a combined approach from the start remains to be elucidated.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Pelvic Floor Muscle Therapy/Biofeedback</u></strong></p>
  <p>Kegel, over&nbsp; 60 years ago, is  credited with the introduction of pelvic floor muscle therapy to treat urinary  incontinence in adult females with stress urinary incontinence in whom he  reported success in 64 patients with the aid of his &ldquo;Perineometer&rsquo; (94).&nbsp; Whereas Kegel applied these principles to  adult women with post-partum incontinence it was Maizels who first applied the  principle of Biofeedback to children (95). Two thirds of adults who have benefitted  from pelvic floor muscle training and have continued to practice the exercises  have been found to have sustained improvement 10 years later (96).&nbsp; In the pediatric population pelvic floor  muscle rehabilitation has been utilized with good success to increase floor  muscle awareness in children with dysfunctional voiding, recurrent urinary  tract infections with poor bladder emptying and vesico-ureteric reflux.&nbsp; What is not clear from the literature is  whether education alone, Kegel&rsquo;s exercises or biofeedback&nbsp; therapy provide the best outcome.&nbsp; Biofeedback therapy provides real-time  monitoring of a particular physiologic function in either an audible or visual  manner to enable learned control of that function.&nbsp; Modern day biofeedback for lower urinary  tract dysfunction is usually based on either uroflowmetry or pelvic floor  muscle electromyography.&nbsp; There is a  paucity of published randomized trials evaluating pelvic floor muscle therapy  or Biofeedback.&nbsp; What has been published  prohibits meaningful meta-analysis as different, often incompletely defined,  treatment strategies have been used to treat a heterogeneous group of  conditions.&nbsp; With a mean of 2.8  behavioral therapy sessions (range 1- 7) administered by a trained psychologist  they reported improvement in daytime urinary control in 72.7% at 12 months that  was sustained in 59.6% at 5 years.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Wiener <em>et al</em> reported  short and medium term outcomes following what they describe as simple  behavioral therapy for children with daytime urinary incontinence (93).&nbsp; Reporting on 48 responding participants from  an original cohort of 74, with a median follow-up of 5 years.&nbsp; This was neither a randomized nor a blinded  study with some patients receiving counseling, some anti-cholinergics and some  both.&nbsp; That said their conclusion that  more intensive/invasive Biofeedback therapy may not be necessary in a large  proportion of patients has some merit.&nbsp;  In line with this thinking many centers have reported their management  algorithm of escalating intervention.</p>
  <p>For those in whom an escalation to Biofeedback is necessary there is  an ever increasing number of treatment options.&nbsp;  Uroflowmetry-based biofeedback aims to promote a bell-shaped urine flow  curve by providing a real-time on-screen visual display during voiding.&nbsp; Whilst uroflow-based treatment has been shown  to achieve similar results to EMG-based therapy in fewer sessions, it is a very  labour-intensive therapy and sessional duration must be prolonged by the need  to re-fill the bladder after each void, individual sessions taking 6 hours as  compared with 45-90mins for EMG-based treatment (97).&nbsp; EMG-based biofeedback which initially used  auditory or linear computer traces have evolved into interactive computer  games.&nbsp; These were initially introduced  by McKenna in 1999 who reported success rates approaching 100% (98).&nbsp; This high level of success has been repeated  by others such as Schulman who reported 80-100% resolution of daytime wetting  and 67-94% normalization of uroflow curves (97); DePaepe <em>et al</em> reported 83% resolution of recurrent UTIs secondary to  dysfunctional voiding with weekly EMG based biofeedback, with some requiring as  many as 24 sessions(99); Porena <em>et al</em> reported complete resolution of dysfunctional voiding in all 43 children  (occurred more quickly in girls) and 87% resolution of associated recurrent  UTIs at 2 year follow-up which reduced to 80% at 4 years (100). The application  of EMG-based biofeedback has been extended to patients with detrusor  overactivity with reports of 66% success in patients with refractory DO (101)  thought to be acting at least in part thru enhanced suppression of detrusor  contraction secondary to pelvic floor contraction (102).&nbsp; It has also been shown to have a positive  impact on vesico-ureteric reflux often seen to be associated with dysfunctional  voiding with complete resolution in 63% and a down-grade in severity in a  further 29% (103).&nbsp; Biofeedback therapy  continues to evolve with continued experimentation of new techniques such as  intra-vesical biofeedback to increase bladder capacity (104).</p>
  <p>What remains to be determined are questions around ideal patient  selection, treatment location and duration.&nbsp;  In line with an increasingly minimalist approach to patient  investigation and management some units are providing home based biofeedback  with reasonable success (105).&nbsp; There  have been a number of studies that have attempted to quantify the additional  benefit of biofeedback over standard urotherapy without much success  (97,106).&nbsp; This may be because of poor  patient selection and a lack of heterogeneity in the study population.&nbsp; What is clear is that the addition of  computer-based animation shortens the duration of treatment necessary to  achieve the same effect (107,108).&nbsp; All  of the work published in this area points to two areas of absolute importance  to a successful outcome, firstly, a motivated and compliant patient and  secondly an enthusiastic, trained and dedicated urotherapist (whether that be a  nurse, physiotherapist or doctor is not important).</p>
  <p><strong><u>Pharmacotherapy</u></strong></p>
  <p>When considering pharmacological intervention for patient with  dysfunctional voiding and other daytime wetting disorders therapeutic agents  can used to target either the bladder itself (detrusor muscle) or the bladder  neck/proximal urethra.&nbsp; For either target  one can choose agents intended to stimulate or suppress.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Stimulants or Agonists</u></strong></p>
  <p>Direct bladder stimulation, for patients with under-active  detrusor/lazy bladder, with agents such as Bethanechol or Carbachol that act  directly on the muscarinic receptor to stimulate it or Distigmine, an  acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that acts by preventing the breakdown of  acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction has largely been abandoned due to  lack of proven benefit (109,110).&nbsp;  Bethanechol which was used a lot for GI motility disorders, is enjoying  something of a resurgence as a detrusor pro-kinetic for the prevention of  post-hysterectomy urinary retention (111).</p>
  <p>The list or active neurotransmitters in the bladder neck and urethra  and therefore potential targets for pharmacotherapy is ever expanding including  a) Adrenergic alpha (- contraction) of which there are 4 different subtypes  present and beta (- relaxation) receptors, 2 sub=types present; b) Cholinergic  muscarinic (M2 and M3) receptors; c) Nonadrenergic Noncholinergic (NANC)  pathways including Nitric Oxide, ATP, Carbon Monoxide, VIP, Neuropeptide Y,  Tachykinins, Prostanoids, Endothelins, 5-Hydroxytryptamine, Rho-kinase to  mention but a few!!&nbsp;&nbsp; For a more detailed  discussion on these pathways the reader is directed to the Canda and Schwinn  papers (112,113).&nbsp; Many of these  pathways/potential targets have only recently been described and as such  therapeutic agents have yet to be developed.</p>
  <p>There is ample evidence that Alpha-adrenergic activity contributes  significantly to urethral tone.&nbsp;  Ephedrine and Phenylpropanolamine both directly stimulate alpha and beta  receptors and cause local release of noradrenaline and thereby increase  urethral tone.&nbsp; Unfortunately they are  not urethral specific and are associated with high blood pressure,  palpitations, headaches and tremors thereby limiting their clinical use.&nbsp; There has been some success with their use in  adult post-menopausal women with stress incontinence when used in combination  with oestrogen therapy (114).&nbsp; Imipramine  is a tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits noradrenaline re-uptake, increasing  urethral tone and raising urethral closing pressure.&nbsp; It also has some anti-cholinergic properties  (discussed in the chapter on nocturnal enuresis) and possibly a central effect  related to its inhibition of serotonin re-uptake (115). Duloxetine is also a  noradrenaline and 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor has also been shown to be better  than placebo for women suffering from stress urinary incontinence (116).</p>
  <p>Clenbutarol, a beta-receptor agonist, has been shown to have benefit  in adult women with urinary incontinence, through an unknown mechanism but  possibly by acting directly on urethral striated.&nbsp; A bladder selective beta-agonist may aid in  the treatment of detrusor overactivity and avoid the cardio-vascular  side-effects (Tachycardia, hypotension) of non-selective ones. Mirabegron is  just such a selective beta3-adrenoreceptor agonist that has already been  approved and trialled in Japan is well tolerated, effective and associated with  minimal side effects (117).</p>
  <p><strong><u>Inhibitors or Antagonists</u></strong></p>
  <p>Inhibitors or antagonists may be used to treat inappropriate bladder  contractions as in detrusor overactivity or to further reduce outlet resistance  and improve bladder emptying efficiency as in dysfunctional voiding.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Anti-muscarinics</u></strong><br>
    The most common class of drugs used to treat detrusor overactivity  are the anti-muscarinic family of drugs, believed to act by blocking the  muscarinic receptors on the detrusor muscle, preventing stimulation by  Acetylcholine.&nbsp; Given that they work  primarily to reduce symptoms of urgency and to increase &lsquo;functional&rsquo; bladder  capacity there exact mechanism of action is uncertain.&nbsp; There are 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1  - M5).&nbsp; In human detrusor M2  receptors account for 2/3 and M3 the remainder.&nbsp; M3 are responsible for detrusor  contraction in the normal bladder. M2 receptors in the bladder seem  to function to oppose sympathetically induced bladder relaxation. M4  receptors are pre-synaptic and though to inhibit neurotransmitter release,  whereas M1 are thought to facilitate ACh release.&nbsp; Muscarinic receptors are also found on  urothelial cells.&nbsp; Anti-muscarinic drugs  exert their effect during the storage phase of bladder function, during which  there is no parasympathetic activity.&nbsp;  There must be some other source of acetylcholine, possibly the  urothelium, that is contributing to detrusor muscle tone (118).&nbsp; This would in part explain the association of  detrusor overactivity and urinary tract infection or bladder inflammation.</p>
  <p><u>Propanthline Bromide</u> is a quaternary  ammonium compound that is a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist.&nbsp; It has a low (5-10% bioavailability and has  to be taken four times a day (119).&nbsp; In a  number of comparative studies in both&nbsp;  adults and children with idiopathic detrusor overactivity it has been  shown to be no better than oxybutynin t.d.s. or in some cases placebo.</p>
  <p><u>Trospium Chloride</u> is another quaternary  ammonium compound with non-selective anti-muscarinic and possibly ganglion  blocking activity.&nbsp; It has been shown to  have similar effect to oxybutynin, with fewer side effects, in patients with  neurogenic detrusor overactivity .&nbsp;  Interestingly it has been found to have better long term compliance than  many of its rivals, perhaps related to its twice daily administration and  better side effect profile (120).</p>
  <p><u>Emepronium bromide</u> is a similar  non-selective anti-muscarinic quaternary ammonium administered 4 times a day  with some proven benefit in adult women but no studies in children.&nbsp; Emepronium bromide has been withdrawn because  of oesophageal ulceration, however Emepronium carrageenate may still be  available.</p>
  <p><u>Oxybutynin</u> is a tertiary amine that has  anti-muscarinic, direct muscle relaxant and local anaesthetic (only relevant if  administered intra-vesically) effects.&nbsp;  It is a chiral compound with R- and S- enantiomers.&nbsp; The majority of its impact on detrusor  overactivity is related to its anti-muscarinic properties.&nbsp; It is the first anticholinergic to have been  approved for use in detrusor overactivity, having been approved by the US FDA  in 1975.&nbsp; In-vitro it is 500 times more  potent as an anti-muscarinic agent than as a direct muscle relaxant.&nbsp; It seems to have a higher affinity for M1  and M3 receptors, having 10-fold greater affinity for M3  over M2 (121).&nbsp; The immediate release  formulation has a bio-availability of about 6%, but with a marked, up to  8-fold, variability between subjects (122).&nbsp;  Oxybutynin is metabolized in the liver by Cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A  into an active metabolite N-desethyl-oxybutynin which results in higher  concentrations than the parent compound and may be largely responsible for the  therapeutic effect.&nbsp;  N-desethyl-oxybutynin also appears to have higher affinity for the  parotid gland, implicating it in the major side effect of dry mouth.&nbsp; That said studies have failed to show a  correlation between volume of saliva production and the sensation of dry mouth  (123).&nbsp; The relatively small size of both  oxybutynin and its primary metabolite coupled with its fat solubility mean it  crosses the blood/brain barrier easily and contributes to its CNS side effect  profile.&nbsp; Plasma concentrations of  oxybutynin have a half-life of 2 hours (124) but given the therapeutic effect  of it&rsquo;s primary metabolite administration bd or tds is generally  recommended.&nbsp; The initial dose of  oxybutynin is somewhat subjective given variability in patient population.&nbsp; For children less than 5 years old a dose of  immediate release formulation 0.2mg/kg/dose tds or 1mg/year of age bd to a max  of 5mg bd.&nbsp; For those&nbsp; between 5 and 10 years of age 5mg bd and for  those &gt; 10years old 10mg bd of immediate release or 10mg of extended release  once daily.&nbsp; In general we start with a  lower dose (to avoid side effects) and dose increase, following a failure to  achieve the desired effect, at an interval of 1-2 months (122).</p>
  <p>Oxybutynin is available in a number of formulations including  immediate release, extended release and transdermal.&nbsp; The immediate release formulation remains the  gold-standard against which newer drugs and formulations are compared.&nbsp; To improve compliance thru less frequent  dosing and reduce side effects by limiting peak levels a once daily extended  release or slow release formulation was developed (125).&nbsp; The extended release formulation makes use of  an osmotic release system (OROS&reg;).&nbsp;  This consists of a 2 layer core the outer containing oxybutynin chloride  and the inner osmotic agents.&nbsp; Once in  the GI tract&nbsp; water ingress creates a  suspension of the oxybutynin that is slowly expelled thru a small hole in the  capsule membrane by expansion of the osmotic agents (126).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is released throughout the GI tract but  primarily in the colon which minimizes its first pass metabolism resulting in a  higher bioavailability of oxybutynin and reduced levels of  N-desethyl-oxybutynin.&nbsp; Transdermal  oxybutynin evolved again from a desire to avoid or minimize first pass  metabolism and is possible because of its lipophilicity.&nbsp; The system consists of a polyester strip that  is removed to apply to the skin.&nbsp; An  outer protective layer and an adhesive layer that contains both the oxybutynin  and triacetin to enhance skin permeation.&nbsp;  It is applied twice weekly, reaches a steady state by the second  application and results in minimal fluctuations in plasma concentrations of  oxybutynin during the 96-hour wear period.&nbsp;  Patch construction is capable of delivering 1mg/day/cm2 and currently  the patch exists in only one size that delivers 3.9mg/day.&nbsp; It can however be cut with similar certainty  of dose.</p>
  <p>Immediate release oxybutynin has been demonstrated to reduce urinary  frequency&nbsp; by about 50% and urge  incontinence by 70% when compared to placebo (124).&nbsp; The extended release formulation has the same  efficacy as the immediate release but is better tolerated with up to 57%  reduction in side effects (127).&nbsp; The  OBJECT (overactive bladder: judging effective control and treatment) trial  found extended release oxybutynin to be more effective than immediate release  tolterodine with similar side effects.&nbsp;  The OPERA (Overactive bladder: performance of extended release agents)  trial found similar reductions in urge incontinence with both extended release  oxybutynin and long-acting tolterodine (128).&nbsp;  Oxybutynin had a greater impact on frequency of micturition but was  associated with a higher incidence of dry mouth.&nbsp; Transdermal oxybutynin is associated with  fewer complaints of dry mouth than extended release preparations.</p>
  <p><u>Tolterodine</u> is another tertiary amine,  anti-muscarinic that though not selective for any specific muscarinic receptor,  has enhanced selectivity for bladder over salivary glands.&nbsp; It has similar affinity for muscarinic  receptors as oxybutynin and also undergoes significant first pass metabolism in  the liver again to an active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine. 7% of caucasians  do not metabolize tolterodine.&nbsp; It has  quite marked bioavailability ranging from 10-70% that is enhanced by taking  with food.&nbsp; As discussed above it comes  in both immediate release and extended release formats which contains the  active agent in soluble microspheres (129).</p>
  <p>The efficacy of tolterodine  has been discussed above.&nbsp; Unlike the  OPERA trial the ACET (Anti-muscarinic clinical effectiveness trial) found 4mg  Tolterodine extended release to have better efficacy and tolerability than  extended release oxybutynin (130).</p>
  <p><u>Fesoterodine</u> is an inactive tertiary  amine that is metabolized to 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, the same metabolite  as tolterodine. It has been demonstrated to haver greater efficacy than  tolterodine but with higher rates of dry mouth and discontinuation because of adverse  events (131).<br>
      <u>Solifenacin </u>is a tertiary amine with M3  selectivity.&nbsp; it has 90% bioavailability  after oral administration.&nbsp; It has been  shown to be as effective as oxybutynin but with fewer side effects.&nbsp; It was also found to have enhanced efficacy  compared to tolterodine (132).&nbsp; It has  been used with moderate success in the treatment of  therapy resistant detrusor overactivity in children(133).&nbsp; Of the 108 patients in the study, 42% had had  complications related to their previous anti-cholinergic therapy with only 9  (6.5%) experiencing side-effects on Solifenacin.&nbsp; Of the patients eligible for assessment 85%  were improved on Solifenacin, of whom 54% had a complete response and 46% a  partial response.<br>
      <u>Darifenacin</u> is an engineered tertiary amine and selective M3  antagonist (121). It has been shown to be better than placebo for urinary  symptoms but to still cause significant dry mouth.&nbsp; That said it has demonstrated long-term  tolerability in an open label study of adults with &gt;40% of patients claiming  &gt;90% reduction in incontinence episodes at 2 years (134).&nbsp; One of the major advantages of Darifenacin  and Solifenacin is the once daily administration.<br>
    Propiverine,  used primarily in children with nocturnal enuresis has been shown to have both  anti-cholinergic and calcium-channel antagonistic properties (119).&nbsp; Again it has been shown to have similar  efficacy compared to oxybutynin but with fewer side effects, experienced in 20%  and primarily related to its anti-cholinergic properties.&nbsp; Theoretically calcium channel blockers by  preventing calcium in-flux could thereby inhibit detrusor contraction none of  the studies thus far looking at Nifedepine or Verapamil have proven effective.<br>
    Flavoxate is a  drug with uncertain mechanism of action but known calcium-channel antagonistic  properties, that also inhibits phosphodiesterase.&nbsp; It has similar efficacy when compared with  oxybutynin, with fewer side effects.<br>
    Capsaicin and  Resiniferatoxin are from a family of drugs called vanilloids.&nbsp; Capsaicin is the ingredient in chili peppers  that elicits the burning sensation by selectively activating sensory  neurons,&nbsp; It acts by stimulating  Transient Receptor Potential cation channels of the vanilloid sub-family  (TRPV-1).&nbsp; It acts by initially  stimulating and later blocking or desensitizing the sensory nerves possible  thru depletion of neuropeptide stores, in particular of unmyelinated  C-fibres.&nbsp; Capsaicin has used  efficaciously in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity and found to  last from 2-7 months after a single administration, in those for whom it  worked.&nbsp; The most significant side-effect  is intense bladder discomfort that is best managed by either administration  under GA or prior intravesical administration of lignocaine (119).&nbsp; Resiniferatoxin is derived from Euphorbia, a  cactus-like plant, that similarly acts on TRPV-1 but with 1000-fold potency  compared to Capsaicin, but with only 100-fold the inflammatory effect. It  appears to have less excitatory effect (prior to subsequent desensitization)  than Capsaicin and hence may be a better alternative. While Resiniferatoxin has  been used for patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity there have been no  reports of its use in children that this author could find and there has been  only one report of its use in patients with idiopathic detrusor overactivity.  In a nonrandomized study of adult patients with IDO that failed to respond to  anti-cholinergic medication, were treated with out-patient intra-vesical  instillation of Resiniferatoxin on a weekly basis, preceded by intra-vesical  lignocaine, for 4 weeks with 50% response rates (135).</p>
  <p><strong><u>Choice of Anti-cholinergic</u></strong><br>
Kessler in a  large meta-analysis of anticholinergic therapy looking at 69 trials and  &gt;26,000 patients found that with the exception of immediate release  oxybutynin all other anti-cholinergics have very similar side effect profiles  (136).&nbsp; Cost and availability are  important considerations when choosing an anticholinergic with little published  data on either.&nbsp; Hashim and Abrams in  2004 found a cost differential, in the UK, between Oxybutynin immediate release  and Tolterodine (either formulation) of 6 -fold (137).&nbsp; Here in Australia Oxybutynin extended  release, Tolterodine LA, Fesoterodine and Trospium are all not available,  thereby influencing selection.</p>
  <p><u>Botulinum  Toxin</u><br>
    Botulinum toxin  is one of the most potent neurotoxin known, produced by Clostridium Botulinum,  that comes in 7 sero-types (A-G) of which 2 (A &amp; B) have been used  clinically (138).&nbsp; It binds to peripheral  nerves, preventing the release of acetylcholine, by cleaving SNARE (soluble  N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins (BTX-A cleaves  synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP-25); BTX-B cleaves vesicle associated  membrane protein (VAMP)).&nbsp; This prevents  vesicle migration to and fusion with the pre-synaptic membrane.&nbsp; It is important to understand that different  preparations of BTX-A (Onabotulinum Toxin - Botox &amp; Abobotulinum Toxin -  Dysport) have dramatically different potencies.&nbsp;  Similarly BTX-B exists if different preparations (Myobloc &amp; Neurobloc).<br>
    BTX-A was first  used in 1998 to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity and urinary incontinence  in adults with spinal cord injury (139). Seventeen of 21 were improved 6 week  slater and this was maintained in 16 at 36 weeks.&nbsp; A systematic literature review by Karsenty <em>et al</em> identified 18 articles  investigating the safety and efficacy of Botox in adults with NDO, with most  studies reporting 40-80% continence rates following injection (140).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s use in patients with NDO has been associated  with a dramatic reduction in the need for bladder augmentation (141).&nbsp; The effect happens with 7-30 days and lasts  from 6-9months.&nbsp; It has been shown to  improve quality if life in patients with both IDO and NDO (142).<br>
    Intravesical  Botox in children with NDO has been reported to achieve continence in 65-87%  (143).&nbsp; The optimal dose of onabotulinum  toxin A for detrusor overactivity has gradually been reduced from a maximum of  300IU to 100IU without loss of efficacy (144).&nbsp;  In fact reducing the dose injected to 100IU results in a significant  reduction in complications related to Botox such as urinary tract infection,  acute urinary retention and need for intermittent catheterization.&nbsp; The intra-vesical use of 100units of Botox in  children with non-neurogenic detrusor overactivity, resistant to  anti-cholinergic therapy yielded a complete response in 60%, a partial response  in 20% and no response in 20% after 6 months, at the expense of temporary  urinary retention in 5% and UTI in 10% (145).&nbsp; <br>
    The first use  of botulinum toxin in a child was by Steinhardt in 1997 where it was used to  treat dramatic urethral dilatation in a girl with dysfunctional voiding  (146).&nbsp; Since then there have been a  number of reports if its use in children with dysfunctional voiding.&nbsp; Franco <em>et  al</em> retrospectively reported on 16 patients with EMG proven dysfunctional  voiding and urinary incontinence that had failed all previous therapies  including Biofeedback and alpha-blocker therapy (147).&nbsp; They reported 75% dryness and 20% improved  after a single injection, with a significant reduction in post-void residuals  but interestingly no change in uroflowmetry.&nbsp;  A similar improvement, without affecting uroflowmetry, was demonstrated  by Petronijevic and seen to last 6 months (148).</p>
  <p><strong><u>Alpha-Blockers</u></strong><br>
    Stimulation of  the large concentration of alpha receptors found in the region of the bladder  neck and urethra results in increased outlet resistance (149).&nbsp; Cain <em>et  al</em> reported on 55 consecutive children with urinary incontinence and  inadequate bladder emptying treated with Doxazosin at a dose of 0.5-2mg/day  (150) in addition to other &lsquo;standard&rsquo; therapy.&nbsp;  They found an 88% reduction in post-void residual urine volumes,  improvement in urinary incontinence in 83% and a reduction in urgency in 70%.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Future Directions for Pharmacotherapy</u></strong></p>
  <p>Our increased understanding of neurophysiology of bladder  contraction is revealing new and potentially novel targets for the treatment of  lower urinary tract dysfunction including connexin 43 and c-kit (involved in  cell coupling or signal translation); cannabinoid and beta-3 receptors  antagonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (151).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><u>Neuromodulation</u></strong></p>
  <p>For that minority of patients whose symptoms persist despite  urotherapy, biofeedback and pharmacotherapy the next level of intervention is  some form of electrical neuromodulation.&nbsp;  It is difficult to find a clear definition of neuromodulation but  essentially it is a therapy that aims to bring about a therapeutic modulation  of neural activity thru&rsquo; stimulation of the central peripheral or autonomic  nervous systems.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s origins have been  traced to the first century AD where Scribonius Largus described the  application of live Torpedo fish to treat gout.&nbsp;  The use of electricity as a therapeutic agent enjoyed a large resurgence  during the late 19th and early 20th centuries but it has really been it the  last 2-3 decades, in conjunction with our enhanced understanding of  neurophysiology that significant progress has been made in this area.&nbsp; Neuromodulatory techniques have been  successfully applied to patients with neuropathic pain, anorexia, epilepsy,  depression, OCD and now also with bladder dysfunction.&nbsp; A number or techniques have been used to  treat detrusor overactivity including Transcutaneous Electrical Neural  Stimulation (TENS), Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS), implantable  sacral nerve root stimulation (Interstim).&nbsp;  The exact mechanism of action of neuromodulation is not known but is  thought to act thru stimulation of both bladder afferents and efferents.&nbsp; Detrusor overactivity may have in part its  origins in the emergence of new reflex arcs involving C-fibers within the  bladder wall.&nbsp; It is thought that by  directly stimulating these nerves that sacral neuromodulation may interfere  with these reflex contractions.&nbsp; PTNS is  thought to act in a similar way but at either the sacral cord or supra-spinal  level, so too Pudendal nerve, dorsal penile nerve and endo-anal stimulation  (152).</p>
  <p>TENS treatment in children with detrusor overactivity, who failed  anticholinergic therapy has been associated with an initial response in 76% and  cure at 1 year in 56% (153).&nbsp; Response  rates of 13-73% have been reported in children with daytime urinary incontinence  (154-156).&nbsp; Up to a quarter of patients  failed to demonstrate any response to TENS therapy (157).&nbsp; It is noteworthy that in an elegant  randomized and blinded (not easy to do!) study by Lordelo <em>et al</em> that up to a third of sham treated patients reported a  significant improvement in symptoms of overactive bladder, though none reported  cure (158).&nbsp; Given that TENS therapy is  associated with discomfort at the skin level patient compliance is a concern  with drop-out or non compliance rates of 11-22% reported.&nbsp; Malm-Buatsi et al reported incomplete  adherence to treatment regimen because of discomfort in 11%, and complete  abandonment in 5.5%.&nbsp; Hoebeke reported  22% lack of success because of a lack of motivation and therefore presumed  non-compliance.&nbsp; Once treatment is  stopped relapse rates of 10-25% have been reported (153,158).&nbsp; Advances in technology and electro-physiology  have led to the development of a new generation of TENS machine that utilizes  interfering electrical currents to minimize skin discomfort to improve  compliance (159,160).&nbsp; TENS therapy has  the additional advantage of being able to be administered at home.</p>
  <p>Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation on the other hand cannot be  administered at home as this more invasive therapy involves the insertion of a  percutaneous needle electrode near the medial malleolus of the ankle.&nbsp; of the 75 children enrolled in 3 different  trials of PTNS symptomatic improvement was reported in 78-84% (161-163).&nbsp; Up to a third of patients discontinue  therapy, of which 10% do so because of a fear of the needle (161).</p>
  <p>Interstim is a surgically implanted system designed to deliver  sacral neuromodulation that was approved by the FDA for the treatment of urge  incontinence in 1997 and for the treatment of urinary retention since  1999.&nbsp; If a percutaneously inserted  temporary needle electrode (at the S3 foramen) connected to an external pulse  generator is proven to be successful the system is converted to a fully  implanted pulse generator.&nbsp; Since 1997  over 100,000 units have been installed worldwide, mainly in adult  patients.&nbsp; Interstim was reported to have  an initial success rate in 84% of 19 patients, with complete resolution of  urinary incontinence in 16% and improvement (defined as greater than 50%  reduction in symptoms) in 68% (164).&nbsp;  Those who improved went from a mean of 1.45 episodes of incontinence per  day to 0.64.&nbsp; This group of researchers  continued to follow some of this group of patients and also to add new  patients.&nbsp; With improved patient  selection (largely based on patient motivation) they reported 88% improvement  in urinary incontinence (75% complete resolution, 12.5% partial resolution  (165).&nbsp; They also reported improvement in  other areas such as urinary urgency (69%) and constipation (71%).&nbsp; They openly acknowledge the nonrandomized  nature of this study of a technique applied to a very heterogenous cohort of  patients.&nbsp; Whilst only 5 (25%) of  patients were rendered symptom free, only 6 (30%) of patients were able to stop  all adjuvant pharmacotherapy and 4 (20%) of patients required surgery for  complication of the device they have shown that Interstim therapy can be  utilized in carefully selected children with refractory incontinence with  modest hope of success.</p>
  <p>Functional magnetic stimulation (FMS) using a device capable of  generating low frequency pulsating electromagnetic fields e.g. Pulsegen or  NeoControl.&nbsp; In the only published trial  to compare FMS with electrical neuromodulation (FES) Yamanishi <em>et al</em> reported increases in both maximum  cystometric capacity and bladder volume at first desire to void (166).&nbsp; They found a significantly greater increase  (114+/124mls) in the FMS group than in the FES group (32+/-57mls), though the  pre-treatment mean volume in the FMS group was small than that in the FES  group.&nbsp; FMS completely abolished detrusor  overactivity in 3 of 15 patients, whereas FES did not achieve this in any  patient.&nbsp; In a placebo controlled trail  of FMS But did not report any cures but did find a 56% reduction in urinary incontinence  symptoms in the control group compared with 26% in the placebo group (167).</p>
  <p><strong><u>Operative Management</u></strong></p>
  <p>Surgical intervention for dysfunctional voiding is usually reserved  for those intractable patients who have failed all of the aforementioned  therapeutic interventions.&nbsp; Fortunately this  is an ever reducing percentage of the overall population but it does represent  those that are the most difficult and despairing to treat.&nbsp; Clearly there will have been some operative  intervention by the urologist before this watershed point for instance  cystoscopy may have been undertaken for diagnostic reasons, to insert a  supra-pubic catheter for video-urodynamics or for Botox injection.  Neurosurgical involvement may have been sought to insert the tined electrode  for Interstim therapy.&nbsp; Beyond this the  nature of the surgical intervention will be tailored to particular subtype of  voiding dysfunction.</p>
  <p>Patients with detrusor under-activity, recurrent UTIs secondary to  dysfunctional voiding with large post-void residuals and those with  non-neurogeneic neurogenic bladder may require surgical intervention to  facilitate bladder emptying.&nbsp; Clean  intermittent catheterization was originally described by Lapides in 1972  (168).&nbsp; Interestingly he described clean  catheterization to help prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in patients  with neuropathic bladders but not by reducing post-void residuals themselves  which he thought were of &ldquo;doubtful importance in the genesis of urinary  infection&rdquo;.&nbsp; Rather he believed that raised  intra-vesical pressure compromised intra-mural blood flow and thereby impaired  host immune defenses.&nbsp; The advantage of  the &lsquo;clean&rsquo; approach is the simpler preparation and a recent Cochrane review  was unable to find any evidence of difference in frequency of UTI when  comparing &lsquo;sterile&rsquo; with &lsquo;clean&rsquo; catheterization.&nbsp; In one of the largest reports on the use of  CIC in neurologically normal children with voiding dysfunction Pohl et al  published 70% tolerability or compliance with CI in children with sensate  urethrae (169).&nbsp; With a mean age of 4.5  (1.5-9) years, 15 of these children learned CIC within 2 days, 4 refused to  learn after the initial visit and the remaining 4 took 2 weeks to learn (of  whom 3 stopped soon after).</p>
  <p>For the 30% or so of children in whom the need to improve bladder  emptying has been identified but who cannot/will not perform CIC per urethra an  alternative route may need to found.&nbsp;  Originally described by Mitrofanoff in 1980 to facilitate bladder  emptying in patients who were simultaneously undergoing bladder neck closure  (16/23) or subsequently underwent bladder neck closure (a further 5 patients)  in patients with neuropathic bladders (170).&nbsp;  With 20 year follow-up they reported 47% stomal complications of either  stenosis or leakage and intestinal complications (volvulus or adhesions) in  5(22%) patients.&nbsp; This technique has been  applied to children with sensate urethrae (171-173).&nbsp; The actual technique of Mitrofanoff formation  is discussed elsewhere.</p>
  <p>For patients with detrusor over-activity once all of the  non-operative therapies have been exhausted surgical intervention aims to  increase functional bladder capacity and reduce the maximal detrusor pressure  which currently involves some form of bladder augmentation either in the form  of augmentation cystoplasty or auto-augmentation. Auto-augmentation, originally  described in 1989 by Cartwright and Snow but its not a procedure that produces  as large an increase in bladder capacity as ileo-cystoplasty and does not last  as long (174).&nbsp; Other techniques such as  trans-trigonal phenol injection and detrusor transection have been abandoned  because of a lack of consistent efficacy and/or longevity.&nbsp; Detailed discussion of the operative  techniques is covered elsewhere in this book.&nbsp;  Augmentation cystoplasty utilizes either sigmoid or ileum, with a  preference for the latter as it results in better compliance and produces less  mucus. It must be remembered that following augmentation a high proportion of  patients 33-50% may require intermittent catheterization.&nbsp; Augmentation cystoplasty remains an  intervention of last choice (175).&nbsp; It  has been reported in adults with non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder to produce a  93% continence rate.&nbsp; Furthermore it has  been shown, after 3 years, to be as cost effective as sacral neuromodulation of  Botox injection.&nbsp; Augmentation  cystoplasty has been shown to be associated with improvements in quality of  life despite recurrent UTIs in a third, a need for prophylactic antibiotics in  15%, and a need to perform CIC in 85% (176).&nbsp;  That said Mundy has reported continence rates of 93% in patients  undergoing augmentation for idiopathic detrusor overactivity (177).&nbsp; They reported CIC rates of only 6% in this  population of patients.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><u>Prognosis</u></strong></p>
  <p>Whilst there are lots of publications detailing the short term  outcome for children with voiding dysfunction there are very few that report  the medium to long-term outcomes.&nbsp; Those  studies by their nature have tended to be cross-sectional rather than  longitudinal.&nbsp; The ALSPAC project which  followed on a birth cohort of 13,793 children followed for 9.5 years reported  that daytime urinary incontinence, which was more common in girls declined in  prevalence from 15.5% at 4.5 years of age to 4.9% at 9.5 years of age  (178).&nbsp; They also found that the  prevalence of more frequent wetting (&gt;2 episodes per week) also reduced from  1.9% to 0.5% over the same time period.&nbsp;  There was a stronger association with urgency in this group who also  were more likely to receive treatment and more likely to remain wet over time.  The same group 12 years earlier reported on urinary symptom progression during  adolescence of over 1,000 school children.&nbsp;  Similarly they found urinary incontinence to be more prevalent in girls  and to decline with age in both sexes (179).&nbsp;  Daytime urinary incontinence fell from 16.6% of 11-12 year old girls to  4.7% of 15-16 year olds.&nbsp; In boys it fell  from 7.2% to 0.98%.&nbsp; The apparent  increase in prevalence from 4.9% at 9.5 years to 16.6% at 11-12 years is  largely explicable for different definitions of incontinence.&nbsp; Of the 25 girls and 4 boys who were wet at  15-16 years, 10 of the girls and 3 of the boys had new onset incontinence, not  present when they were aged 11-12.&nbsp;  Schulman et al reported 45% cure (dry, off all meds) after minimum of 6 month  follow-up in a cohort of 222 children with daytime wetting (180).&nbsp; A further 37% were improved (&gt;50%  reduction in symptoms) but possibly still on medication.&nbsp; The same group subsequently published on a  subset of these patients with&nbsp; 6.5 years  of follow-up reporting 91% complete resolution of daytime wetting with a median  of 2.9 years to dryness (181).&nbsp;  Interestingly despite the comprehensive treatment received (which  included antibiotics, anti-cholinergics, biofeedback and psychological  counseling) parents felt that maturation was the single most important factor  in symptom resolution.&nbsp; In summary the  resolution rates for daytime urinary incontinence is about 0.2% per year of  life from 7 - 17 years of age.</p>
  <p>Of course a small percentage do not resolve and in some cases their  condition deteriorates.&nbsp; This has been  described by some as a dysfunctional voiding sequence which is often considered  to start with detrusor overactivity, which by inducing urethral sphincter  overactivity develops into dysfunctional voiding and ultimately ends in an  under-active detrusor (43).&nbsp; If that  progression exists then it should be evident in age differences between the  different sub-types of voiding dysfunction.&nbsp;  Hoebeke <em>et al</em> reported 1,000  video-urodynamic performed on a selected subset of over 3,500 patients presenting  for investigation of incontinence over a four year period (71).&nbsp; Of the studies 6.2% were normal, 58% detrusor  overactivity, 32% dysfunctional voiding and 4% detrusor under-activity or &lsquo;lazy  bladder&rsquo;.&nbsp; There was no evidence of a  dysfunctional voiding sequence form the ages of these sub-types.&nbsp; It seems that children who are incontinent of  urine have different primary pathologies.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Long-term Outcomes</u></strong></p>
  <p>There have been a number of studies (e.g. NOBLE, EPIC, EpiLUTS)  quantify the prevalence and progression of urinary incontinence in adulthood  (182,183).&nbsp; Wennberg <em>et al</em> followed a randomly selected group of women from Gothenburg,  Sweden over 16 years (184). They found an increased prevalence of urinary  incontinence (see Table 6), frequency, nocturia and overactive bladder to  increase over time. Over the intervening 16 years 21% of women who weren&rsquo;t  wetting initially developed urinary incontinence.&nbsp; A similar sized portion (34%) of those who  wet initially became dry during that same period.&nbsp; The overall prevalence of overactive bladder  increased from 17 to 26% during the 16 year period.&nbsp; All of this increase was in those women with  incontinence as the prevalence rate for OAB dry (i.e. urgency without  incontinence) was 11% initially and 10% 16 years later whereas that for OAB wet  increased from 6% initially to 16% later with a similar increase seen in all  age groups.&nbsp; Many others have reported  similar progression and regression of overactive bladder symptoms&nbsp; in the adult population over time emphasizing  the dynamic nature of LUT dysfunction (185).</p>

  <p>It has long been suspected that there is a correlation between  childhood voiding dysfunction and adult lower urinary tract symptoms.&nbsp; Currently there are no longitudinal studies  that have followed children all the way thru to adulthood.&nbsp; Most studies rely on adult recall of  childhood symptoms.&nbsp; The known  association between adult urinary incontinence and paediatric nocturnal  enuresis has been discussed elsewhere in the chapter on nocturnal enuresis.&nbsp; Minassian <em>et  al</em> reporting a case control study of adult women referred to a  uro-gynaecology clinic with urinary incontinence was unable to demonstrate an  increased likelihood of childhood dysfunctional voiding (186). They found that  42% of the control group of asymptomatic adult women also had a history of  childhood LUTS.&nbsp; However when they  combined both groups for sub-group analysis they found a a significant  correlation between symptomatic women and childhood LUTS concluding that  prospectively following symptomatic children into adulthood may be the only way  to <br>
    answer the question properly.&nbsp;  Fitzgerald <em>et al</em> questioned  2109 randomly selected women, aged between 40 - 69 finding that women who  reported childhood daytime urinary frequency were twice as likely to report  urinary urgency as adults (187).&nbsp;  Furthermore women with a childhood history of urinary incontinence were  2.6 times more likely to suffer from urinary incontinence as an adult.&nbsp; These findings are supported by those of  Bower <em>et al</em> who found that adult  women attending a uro-gynaecology clinic with symptoms of LUT dysfunction who  found that a history or urgency in childhood was associated with a 2.3 fold  increased risk of developing dysfunctional elimination syndrome in adulthood  (188).<br>

  <p><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></p>
  <p>In conclusion the ideal management of patients with voiding  dysfunction begins with a detailed and targeted history and physical  examination.&nbsp; This is supplemented with  appropriate but not excessive investigation.&nbsp;  Treatment begins with education and urotherapy in all patients, before  careful selection of adjuvant therapies.&nbsp;  Central to happy parents and patients is realistic expectations.&nbsp; Lack of realistic expectations (and  particularly a belief in the efficacy of that treatment) contributes to the  drop out rate for medication compliance seen in adults and also in children  (120,189).&nbsp; Too often these children  present to the urologist at the end of their treatment journey and come  expecting a surgical &lsquo;cure&rsquo; or &lsquo;fix&rsquo;.&nbsp; We  can see that none of the therapies discussed above has 100% success rate and as  one moves onto more &lsquo;aggressive&rsquo; treatments the success rates lessen.&nbsp; As is true of the management of nocturnal  enuresis it is likely that greater success will arise from combination therapy  rather than any isolated individual approach (190).</p>
