  <p align="center"><strong>Disorders of sex development</strong><br>
    A 2004 consensus  guidelines workshop held in Chicago<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Hughes, 2006 #118">1</a> resolved that the  use of the term &lsquo;intersex&rsquo; should be abandoned and replaced with a new term,  &lsquo;disorders of sex development&rsquo; or DSD. The workshop defined DSDs as congenital  conditions in which gonadal, anatomical or chromosomal sex is atypical.  Terminology was revised, removing a number or terms that were considered  pejorative (e.g male and female pseudohermaphroditism, testicular feminization,  adrenogenital syndrome, true hermaphroditism, XX male syndrome, sex reversal)  and introducing a new classification (Table 1) based on karyotype, the type of  gonad, and the underlying functional defect, when known. Some genital anomalies  of unknown etiology, such as bladder extrophy and cloacal extrophy, which do  not readily fit into such a classification are grouped as &ldquo;other&rdquo;. The benefits  of the new diagnostic terms are that they are neutral, descriptive and  objective, making them more useful to clinicians when explaining a DSD to the  parents of a child or at a later stage, to the patient.&nbsp; <br>
    Some conditions,  such as Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome, which were not previously  thought of as intersex conditions, are now redefined as DSD because of the sex  chromosome abnormality. &nbsp;<br>
    Some patients with  DSD have atypical anatomy. This may take the form of </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><em>ambiguous genitalia</em> (seen in nearly all females with congenital adrenal       hyperplasia and 5% of babies with a 45,X/46,XY karyotype). </li>
    <li>atypical <em>internal</em> reproductive organs in an individual with no obvious abnormality of the       external genitalia. Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome       (CAIS), for example, have a female phenotype with good breast development,       but the gonads are testes, not ovaries, the uterus and fallopian tubes are       absent, the vagina is relatively short and blind-ending, and there is       little or no pubic or axillary hair.&nbsp;       The abundant amounts of testosterone made in their testes cannot       activate the structurally altered androgen receptor and are aromatized to       oestrogen. Breast development therefore occurs naturally.</li>
    <li>Hypospadias, being a congenital condition associated with       atypical anatomy of the penis, should now be considered as part of the DSD       spectrum, but paediatric urologists will understand that statistically, underlying       endocrine and genetic disorders are usually associated with <em>perineal</em> hypospadias<a href="#_ENREF_2" title="Ogata, 2008 #22">2</a>. In these       cases, it is appropriate to look for persistent Mullerian remnants and to       investigate further. The conditions that might be present include defects       in testosterone biosynthesis or action, Y-chromosome positive gonadal       dysgenesis, or a genital anomaly that is part of a dysmorphic syndrome. Short       stature or other problems that form part of a dysmorphic syndrome,       undescended testis, or a family history of hypospadias should trigger       further investigation and possibly referral to an endocrinologist or       geneticist.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Failure to refer  appropriately may expose the patient to </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>the risk of death from gonadal malignancy<a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Cools, 2006 #127">3</a> (which occurs       in Y-chromosome +ve gonadal dysgenesis and partial androgen insensitivity       syndrome with an intra-abdominal testis) or </li>
    <li>a complex and difficult puberty<a href="#_ENREF_4" title="Cohen-Kettenis, 2005 #178">4</a> (as in       partial androgen insensitivity, when incomplete virilization&nbsp; is often accompanied by significant       breast development and gender dysphoria). </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In some forms of  DSD, the <em>gonads</em> are atypical. They  may be </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>streak gonads (which contain no germ cells), </li>
    <li>small, dysgenic testes with reduced germ cells and with       abnormalities in Leydig cell and Sertoli cell function, or </li>
    <li>ovotestes.&nbsp; In the one       individual with ovotesticular DSD, an ovary may be found on one side and a       testis on the other. </li>
    <li>Some females have testes (see above) and some apparent males       (who are actually fully virilised genetic females with congenital adrenal       hyperplasia) have ovaries.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Sex chromosome  aneuploidy is surprisingly common, affecting 1:600 in the community.&nbsp; The most common variations are</p>

  <p><strong>Sex determination and sexual differentiation</strong><br>
    Sex determination  is the process in which the indeterminate gonad becomes either a testis or an  ovary. Sexual differentiation is the phenotypic change that occurs in the  reproductive organs to make them male or female after the gonad starts to <em>function</em> as a testis or an ovary. In  mammalian systems<a href="#_ENREF_5" title="Wilhelm, 2007 #56">5</a>, sex determination  along the male pathway is initiated by the presence of the SRY gene on the Y  chromosome.&nbsp; This triggers a cascade of  genetic interactions, which is shown in Figure 1. <br>
    The first  morphological change indicating that the gonad is going to be a testis is the  appearance of sex cords which are comprised of Sertoli cells. The foetal  Sertoli cells secrete anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH, also called Mullerian  Inhibitory Substance, or MIS) and Inhibin B. Germ cells migrate into the developing  testis from the allantois. Leydig cells also migrate into the testis, from the mesonephros  and begin secreting testosterone in the&nbsp; 7th  week. The Leydig cells also secrete Insulin-like 3, a protein hormone that is  involved in the regulation of testicular descent.</p>
  <p>Under the  influence of testosterone, the Wolffian ducts enlarge and differentiate into  the vas deferens, the epididymis and the seminal vesicles. The Mullerian ducts  in the male involute in the presence of AMH.<br>
    In the female, ovarian  development occurs in the absence of SRY and the presence of <em>WNT4</em> and <em>RSPO1</em>. Germ cells migrate into the ovary and are identifiable as  oocytes by 11-12 weeks. In the absence of testosterone, the Wolffian ducts  atrophy and in the absence of AMH, the Mullerian ducts differentiate and grow  into the uterus, the fallopian tubes and the upper two-thirds of the vagina.<br>
  <strong>46,XX DSD</strong><br>
  <strong>Disorders of gonad formation</strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>46,XX gonadal dysgenesis</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A rare familial  form of 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis was&nbsp;  first reported in Finland<a href="#_ENREF_6" title="Tapanainen, 1998 #2853">6</a> and found to be due to a mutation in the FSH receptor gene (for which, gene  therapy is showing some promise in experimental research<a href="#_ENREF_7" title="Ghadami, 2008 #2835">7</a>).&nbsp; Sporadic cases may also be seen. Clinically  the patient would be a phenotypic female with absent pubertal development.  Features of Turner syndrome would not be found and the chromosomes would be  normal. Endocrine testing would show raised levels of FSH and LH, with low  levels of oestradiol. The differential diagnosis would include primary ovarian  failure due to a metabolic disorder such as galactosaemia or to autoimmune  endocrinopathy (which would usually occur as part of a polyglandular syndrome).  Ovarian biopsy would show absence of germ cells in 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>46,XX ovotesticular DSD</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Three quarters of  all cases of ovotesticular DSD have a 46,XX karyotype. It is particularly common  among South African black people<a href="#_ENREF_8" title="Wiersma, 2009 #2527">8</a>.  It is usually associated with ambiguous genitalia. At puberty, feminization  with breast development may occur. Whether or not a uterus develops will depend  upon the amount of functional testicular tissue present in utero. The diagnosis  of ovotesticular DSD is made according to strict criteria: testicular tissue is  defined by presence  of seminiferous tubules with spermatogonia, and ovarian tissue is defined by  the presence of numerous primordial and/or maturing follicles within the  ovarian stroma . The gonadal structure is variable,  ranging from an ovary on one side and a dysgenetic testis on the other, to  bilateral ovotestes. An ovotestis may have distinct ovarian and testicular  poles, or the two elements may be distributed more or less uniformly throughout  the gonad. The testicular components always undergo deterioration faster than  the ovarian components and fertility in the male role has not been reported.  Fertile ova may be produced, but even so, fertility is rare. The risk of germ  cell cancer is low (but is higher in cases with a Y chromosome). Treatment  would usually involve removal of the testicular component of the gonads if it  was clearly demarcated, and the purpose would be to remove the source of  testosterone in a person identifying as female.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>46,XX testicular DSD</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Boys with this  condition<a href="#_ENREF_9" title="Ergun-Longmire, 2005 #2838">9</a> generally have normal male genitalia but may be hypogonadal and have dysgenetic  testes that are small or undescended.&nbsp;  The XX karyotype always comes as a surprise. The presence of Y-chromosome  material can be detected by PCR using SRY and other probes in 80% of cases of  46,XX testicular DSD, so these cases may be considered as having a Y to X  translocation and as such, are analogous to males with 47,XXY Klinefelter  syndrome, who have similar clinical features. The explanation for the 20% whose  PCR tests for Y chromosome sequences are negative has not yet been found. The  treatment needed would include orchidopexy and in most cases, hormone  replacement therapy using testosterone commencing with the induction of puberty  and continuing long term. Counselling should reinforce the male gender identity  and it should include an explanation that males can have a range of chromosome  patterns, including XY, XXY, XYY and in some cases, XX. They are still all  males.</p>
  <p><strong>Disorders of androgen excess</strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</li>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>21-hydroxylase deficiency</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>21-Hydroxylase deficiency in the classic form (apparent from birth)  affects approximately 1:14,000 live births. Ninety to 95% of patients with CAH  have 21-hydroxylase deficiency. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive  condition, so 50% are female and 50% are male. Females with 21-hydroxylase  deficiency represent the largest single group of infants born with ambiguous  genitalia and 75% of them have the severe salt-wasting type which is fatal  unless diagnosed and treated in a timely manner.&nbsp; The adrenal cortex in these salt wasting  patients has less than 1% of the normal 21-hydroxylase enzyme activity and the  production of both cortisol and aldosterone is severely deficient. The  pituitary attempts to compensate and ACTH production is high, driving the one  pathway not affected by the enzyme, which is the androgen pathway. This is why  the clitoris becomes enlarged and the labia are partially fused during  intrauterine life. The high levels of ACTH cause hyperpigmentation of the  genital skin. After the first week of life, serum potassium starts to rise and  serum sodium falls, coinciding with a fall in blood pressure due to dehydration  and a risk of death due to adrenal crisis.&nbsp;  Blood glucose may also be dangerously low. The other 25% of patients  have the non-salt wasting form, and their adrenal cortex has between 1 and 3%  of the normal enzyme activity. They also lose excessive salt in the urine, as  indicated by a high plasma renin activity, but not enough to cause serum  electrolyte disturbances or to become symptomatic. Mutational analysis of the  P450CYP21 gene has revealed a large number of mutations of different types  (most common of which are an intron 2 splice mutation and a group of about 9  point mutations) and there is some genotype-phenotype correlation. Girls with  CAH associated with &gt;3% enzyme activity are born with normal genitalia but  may develop clitoromegaly during childhood.<br>
    The key investigation is a serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Levels in  infants with salt wasting CAH are extremely high, and higher than those with  the non-salt wasting form. Serum electrolytes and urea, blood glucose and  chromosomes should also be studied. Urine steroid analysis using gas  chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is useful as a confirmatory test  and it can exclude other, less common forms of CAH, such as 11b-hydroxylase deficiency.<br>
    The urogenital sinus in girls with CAH may sometimes be long and it  is important when planning surgery to determine the distance between the  junction of urethra and vagina and the perineum.<br>
    The treatment of CAH should be initiated and supervised long term by  a paediatric endocrinologist. Initially the infant may need IV fluid, sodium  chloride and glucose, at the same time as IV hydrocortisone is given. Later,  oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone is given, with a salt supplement in the  first 3-6 months of life, and these hormones are needed throughout life, with  regular blood tests to monitor serum 17OHP and plasma renin activity, as well  as clinical follow up to monitor linear growth, weight, blood pressure and  sexual development.<br>
    Genetic counselling is highly desirable as there is a 1:4 risk of  another affected child in future pregnancies, but also because prenatal  diagnosis and even prenatal treatment<a href="#_ENREF_10" title="Fernandez-Balsells, 2010 #776">10</a> with dexamethasone  (to prevent the development of ambiguous genitalia in an affected female) is  possible.<br>
    Psychological support from a mental health professional is  considered essential for girls with CAH. Every effort needs to be made to  establish good self-esteem.<br>
    Long-term outcome studies on women with CAH<a href="#_ENREF_11" title="Johannsen, 2010 #772">11</a> have shown that  rates of sexual dysfunction&nbsp; - avoidance  of sexual relations, painful intercourse, and inability to experience an orgasm  - are high and rates of fertility are low.&nbsp;  Most are heterosexual but there is a modest increase in those who prefer  same sex relationships. A child an adolescent gynaecologist should always be  involved throughout adolescence.<br>
    In resource poor settings<a href="#_ENREF_12" title="Warne, 2008 #12">12</a>, girls with  ambiguous genitalia due to non salt wasting CAH may not see a doctor for years  and as a result, they may become extremely virilised with gross clitoromegaly,  accelerated linear growth (and bone age maturation), deepening of the voice,  acne and a muscular body habitus. If left long enough without treatment, they  stop identifying as female and express the desire to be identified as male.  Treatment of these unfortunate children is very difficult because the  introduction of hydrocortisone to suppress adrenal androgens releases an  already-primed hypothalamus from negative feedback and pituitary gonadotrophins  are secreted, triggering central precocious puberty. The effects of this is to  further curtail linear growth and the child will be a very short adult. In  settings with good resources, the addition of a GnRH analogue would suppress  the gonadotrophin secretion and stop the pubertal process. An even worse  situation results when a girl from a very poor family has been diagnosed with  CAH early in life and has then had surgery to reduce, or even remove, the  clitoris, but then has poor hormone replacement therapy during childhood, and  ends up as someone indentifying as male, but without a phallus.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>11b-hydroxylase        deficiency</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  This  condition accounts for less than 10% of all cases of CAH. Like 21-hydroxylase  deficiency, it also causes virilisation of a female foetus, but unlike  21-hydroxylase deficiency, it is associated with an increase in mineralocorticoids  and retention of salt, so that it causes arterial
  <p>hypertension. In the neonatal period, the blood pressure may be  normal and there may even be a transient salt losing phase, so it can be  difficult to make the correct diagnosis unless the investigations routinely  include a urine steroid GC-MS analysis. Once the correct diagnosis is made, the  appropriate treatment is hydrocortisone to suppress the ACTH and to replace the  missing cortisol. Blood pressure falls as the ACTH-stimulated mineralocorticoid  levels fall. The diagnostic test is serum 11-deoxycortisol, which is grossly  elevated.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>This is a very rare condition but an interesting one, in that it can  cause the genitalia of both genetic females and of genetic males to be  ambiguous. In females, the elevated levels of weak adrenal androgens such as  dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), some of which ends up as testosterone, cause  masculine changes. In genetic males, the elevated adrenal androgens are  insufficient to compensate for the reduced amounts of gonadal testosterone that  are secreted. The enzyme is normally expressed in both the adrenal cortex and  the testis. Severe deficiency of this enzyme is also associated with salt loss  and a risk of adrenal crisis.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Placental aromatase deficiency</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Occasionally a  pregnant woman experiences gestational virilisation (temporal hair loss,  deepening of the voice, clitoral enlargement) and then gives birth to a  virilised female infant. A deficiency of placental aromatase is one of the  causes of this extremely rare event (other causes include maternal ingestion of  androgenic medications, maternal virilizing tumour and oxido-reductase  deficiency). The foetal adrenal glands normally secrete very large amounts of  androgenic steroids, which cross the placenta and are aromatized to oestriol  and other oestrogens. If the placenta lacks aromatase, due to a foetal genetic  mutation in the <em>CYP19A1</em> gene<a href="#_ENREF_13" title="Zirilli, 2008 #2839">13</a>,  the unmodified foetal androgens enter the maternal circulation, cause  virilisation, and are recycled back into the foetus, where the female genitalia  will develop abnormally. The foetal ovaries also need aromatase to function  normally, and so girls with this condition are infertile and have polycystic  ovaries.<br>

Serum FSH  and LH would be very high and oestrogen levels would be low. Ultrasound would  show a normal uterus but the ovaries would be too small to see &ndash; in fact, they  would be streaks with few if any germ cells. The risk of germ cell cancer in  these intra-abdominal streaks is high<a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Cools, 2006 #127">3</a> and laparoscopic removal  of them is essential as soon as the diagnosis is made. Hormone replacement with  continuous oestrogen will be needed; a progestogen would be added once  breakthrough bleeding had started. Counselling should emphasize the positives,  which are that women with this condition have a uterus and can therefore carry  a pregnancy (but of course a donor egg would be needed). Again, the importance  of the XY karyotype is not something to dwell upon as it does not define  gender, but the patient has a right to know about it at an appropriate stage.  All patients with this condition express a female gender identity.<br>
    In 70-80% of cases  of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, the underlying genetic cause is unknown.

    <li>46,XY partial gonadal dysgenesis</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By definition,  children with <em>partial</em> gonadal  dysgenesis (GD) have been exposed prenatally to some testosterone and are born  with genitalia that are ambiguous to some degree. 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis is  much less common than GD associated with sex chromosome aneuploidy (e.g  45,X/46,XY). A uterus is present in some but not all. The risk of germ cell  cancer is very high<a href="#_ENREF_3" title="Cools, 2006 #127">3</a>, especially if the  gonad is intra-abdominal. In a streak gonad, gonadoblastoma is the premalignant  condition seen, while in a better differentiated testis with seminiferous  tubules, carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) is the precursor to germ cell cancer  (seminoma/ germinoma).<br>
    A great deal of  research has been focused on patients with XY GD, looking for mutations in  genes that make up the pathway regulating testicular development, and many have  been identified. Some of the mutated genes are expressed not only in the gonad,  but also in other tissues. <em>WT1</em>, for  example (the Wilms tumour suppressor gene) is expressed in the developing  kidneys as well as the gonad, so patients with <em>WT1</em> mutations have gonadal dysgenesis and dysplastic kidneys prone  to the development of either Wilms tumour, renal failure due to  glomerulosclerosis, or both. <em>SOX9</em> is  expressed in the skeleton as well as the developing testis, which explains why  affected individuals may have the combination of campomelic dysplasia and XY  gonadal dysgenesis.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>46,XY ovotesticular DSD</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Only 25% or less  of cases of ovotesticular DSD have a 46,XY karyotype &ndash; the majority have&nbsp; 46,XX chromosomes. Experimental research in  mice has shown that both 46,XY ovotesticular DSD and 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis  can occur if the timing of action of <em>Sry</em> is disturbed very slightly<a href="#_ENREF_5" title="Wilhelm, 2007 #56">5</a>. The possibility  that some human DSD could be due to variations affecting the time of onset of  gene expression is an interesting one.<br>
      <strong>Disorders of androgen synthesis or action</strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency</li>
  </ul>
  <p>17b-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (HSD17B3) deficiency causes  hypogonadism in genetic males by interrupting the testicular conversion of &Delta;4-androstenedione  to testosterone. After puberty, the ratio of&nbsp;  &Delta;4-androstenedione to testosterone will be high. The  administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin will be necessary to reveal  this in a prepubertal child. The genitalia of an affected XY individual will  generally be ambiguous. Phallic enlargement can occur before puberty. There is  no uterus because the secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone is normal.  Virilization takes place after puberty and some individuals raised female will  develop gender dysphoria or affirm a male identity, even in cases whose testes  were removed during childhood. The other DSD in which this commonly occurs is 5a-reductase 2 deficiency<a href="#_ENREF_15" title="Wilson, 1993 #490">15</a>. HSD17B3  deficiency has a high prevalence in the Palestinian Arab population of the Gaza  Strip and the natural history has been well documented there<a href="#_ENREF_16" title="Rosler, 2006 #98">16</a>. Unless a good  steroid laboratory is available, it can be difficult to distinguish this  condition from partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. The pattern of  inheritance for HSD17B3 deficiency is autosomal recessive (PAIS is an X-linked  condition) but the phenotype is only seen in genetic males; affected females  have no phenotype. Mutational analysis of the HSD17B3 gene will confirm the  diagnosis.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency</li>
  </ul>
  <p>See description of  this condition (above) under 46,XX DSD </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>17a-hydroxylase deficiency</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Deficiency of&nbsp; 17a-hydroxylase (a  very rare condition) affects the adrenal cortex and the gonad, blocking both  the cortisol and androgen pathways in the adrenal cortex, and the secretion of  sex steroids by the testis or ovary. The phenotype is therefore female or  ambiguous in both XY and XX individuals. In addition, there is arterial  hypertension associated with hypokalaemia due to the accumulation of  mineralocorticoids. The hypertension can be controlled by suppressing ACTH  secretion using hydrocortisone. Affected XY individuals have no uterus because  their testes secrete AMH, but XX individuals do have a uterus. Some  virilisation does occur at puberty in XY individuals whose testes have not been  removed and a male gender identity is possible.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Lipoid adrenal hyperplasia</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The cause of  lipoid adrenal hyperplasia is a mutation in the gene for the steroid acute  regulatory protein (StAR)<a href="#_ENREF_17" title="Bose, 1996 #449">17</a>. The StAR protein  transports cholesterol across the mitochondrial membrane and in its absence,  steroid biosynthesis from cholesterol cannot take place and lipoid droplets  accumulate in the cytoplasm of steroidogenic cells of the adrenal cortex and  gonads, making these organs enlarged and dysfunctional. The hyperplastic  adrenals have a bright yellow colour. An infant born with the complete form of  the condition will be phenotypically female regardless of genotype, will have  ACTH-related hyperpigmentation of the skin and will develop severe adrenal  insufficiency with hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and hypoglycaemia in the first  postnatal week. Milder forms of the condition occur and patients with these can  present months or years after birth with adrenal insufficiency<a href="#_ENREF_18" title="Sahakitrungruang, 2010 #2791">18</a>.  Treatment with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone leads to a good outcome. Sex  hormone replacement with oestrogen at puberty is necessary for the development  of secondary sex characteristics. Genetic female patients will have a uterus  and will therefore need a progestogen in addition to oestrogen.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) deficiency</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SF-1 (also known  as <em>NR5A1</em>) is expressed in the  developing adrenals, gonads and hypothalamus. A child with a complete defect in  SF-1 would show failure of adrenal and gonadal development and would be born  female regardless of genotype. Gonadotrophin levels would, however, be low  because of a deficiency of hypothalamic GnRH.<br>
    Heterozygous  SF1 mutations are much more common than was previously thought and can present  as a child with penoscrotal hypospadias, micropenis and bilateral anorchia, &nbsp;micropenis and undescended testes, or as premature ovarian failure in an otherwise healthy girl<a href="#_ENREF_19" title="Bashamboo, 2010 #2790">19</a>.  In all of these examples, adrenal function has generally been normal but  whether or not in the longer term adrenal insufficiency will ensue is unknown.  Similarly, it is unknown if DSD  or hypospadiac patients with SF-1 mutations will have normal puberty and  fertility or if there is an increased risk of testicular tumors due to gonadal  dysgenesis. Long term surveillance of gonadal and adrenal status is advised. </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>CAIS is a well  known condition caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene,  located at Xq11-q12. Infants with CAIS have a completely female phenotype, but  have testes that secrete testosterone and MIS, no uterus or fallopian tubes,  and a short, blind-ending vagina. &nbsp;The  karyotype is 46,XY. The diagnosis is made either during childhood, when an  inguinal hernia is found to contain a testis, or after the onset of puberty,  when the girl develops breasts but no pubic or axillary hair, and there are no  menses. Gender identity is always female. All tissues in the body lack the  androgen receptor, including the hypothalamus, and therefore the normal  negative feedback loop, in which high levels of testosterone suppress pituitary  gonadotrophin secretion, does not operate. Women with CAIS have serum  testosterone levels above the normal male range and it is aromatized to  oestrogen. Serum LH levels are also high.&nbsp;  Although the serum oestradiol levels exceed the normal male range, they  are lower than levels in women with ovaries, and this may explain why women  with CAIS are at risk of osteoporosis<a href="#_ENREF_20" title="Wisniewski, 2002 #247">20</a>.  The shorter length of the vagina is a significant problem in some women and may  make penetrative intercourse impossible. Generally, satisfactory lengthening of  the vagina can be achieved by non-surgical dilatation methods, even by sexual  activity with a patient and persistent partner. Because they have a 46,XY  karyotype, women with CAIS have an average height that is taller than the  average height of women.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an increased risk of germ  cell cancer in the testes of women with CAIS<a href="#_ENREF_21" title="Horcher, 1983 #2840">21</a> but the risk has  been revised<a href="#_ENREF_22" title="Looijenga, 2010 #2438">22</a> and is now thought to be around 2-3%. These cancers only occur after puberty.  In the past it was common for the testes to be removed in childhood &lsquo;to prevent  cancer&rsquo; but this was also in a paternalistic era when doctors were reluctant to  tell parents their daughter had &lsquo;male&rsquo; chromosomes and testes. Removing the  &lsquo;abnormal gonads&rsquo; provided a solution and avoided a difficult discussion later  on. Policies of full disclosure to parents have made it easy to explain the  nature of the condition to them and to involve them in formulating the risk  management plan. Leaving the testes in until after puberty allows physiological  breast development to take place. The recommendation to remove the testes then  still stands, but even this is being questioned, given that there are other  ways of checking the testes for the development of pre-malignant changes (e.g  biopsy for carcinoma-in-situ), provided they are located in a superficial  position. Some women request removal of inguinal testes because of discomfort  and pain.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Partial androgen insensitivity       syndrome (PAIS)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>PAIS is also  believed to be caused by a defect in androgen receptor function, although in  the majority of cases studied, it has not been possible to identify an AR gene  mutation. A few cases have been proven to have had mutations affecting various  AR gene cofactors, but a mystery continues to surround the nature of many  cases. At a clinical level, patients with PAIS have a highly variable  phenotype, even within the one family, and not all have ambiguous genitalia or  even hypospadias. At puberty, most develop significant gynaecomastia. Body hair  is reduced. Positive pointers to a diagnosis of PAIS are a family history  suggesting X-linked inheritance, the combination of a high serum testosterone  and a high serum LH, and identification of an <em>AR </em>gene mutation. In the absence of the latter, other diagnoses,  particularly 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency or X-linked 46,XY gonadal  dysgenesis, should be considered.<br>
    A study of  genetically proven PAIS carried out in Baltimore<a href="#_ENREF_23" title="Wisniewski, 2002 #246">23</a> showed that 25% of  individuals had significant discomfort related to their gender as adults and  some wanted surgery to change their sex. This was regardless of the initial sex  of rearing. Because an unstable gender identity seems to be such a part of  PAIS, any surgery should be planned in such a way that all options for the  future remain open, in other words, tissue should not be removed (as in  feminizing genitoplasty) when gender identity cannot be predicted. Some people  advocate raising all patients with PAIS as boys and carrying out very  conservative hypospadias repair. Others advocate deferring surgery until the  individual has affirmed their gender identity<a href="#_ENREF_24" title="Chase, 1998 #2360">24</a>. The debate  continues. It is clear from the evidence that an intra-abdominal testis  associated with PAIS is highly likely to undergo malignant change and its  removal is essential. The risk of malignancy in a scrotal or inguinal PAIS  testis is lower, but still higher in than the general population, and life-long  surveillance is required if it is to be retained. Biopsy after the onset of  puberty to look for CIS is strongly recommended.<br>
    High-dose  testosterone has been shown to bring about some penile growth in adolescents  with PAIS<a href="#_ENREF_25" title="Weidemann, 1998 #2841">25</a>.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>5a-reductase-2 deficiency</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This condition is  inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The tissue levels of the enzyme 5a-reductase-2 are low, and this leads to impairment in the conversion  of testosterone to the more biologically active androgen, 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Masculine development of the external  genitalia is dependent on DHT, and so affected 46,XY individuals are born with  ambiguous genitalia and testes. Parents often choose to raise the children as  girls, but at puberty, substantial masculinization takes place, with growth of  the phallus and a muscular physique, and often there is a change in gender  identity from female to male. 5a-reductase-2 deficiency has been  reported in many parts of the world but is rare in Caucasian people. Many  different mutations in the 5a-reductase-2 gene have been identified<a href="#_ENREF_15" title="Wilson, 1993 #490">15</a>. <strong></strong><br>

  <ul type="disc">
    <li>45,X/46,XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis</li>
  </ul>
  <p>After congenital  adrenal hyperplasia, 45,X/46,XY mosaicism is the second most common cause of  ambiguous genitalia. Having said that, 95% of babies identified from prenatal  testing as having this karyotype are born with a normal <em>male</em> phenotype and two apparently normal testes<a href="#_ENREF_26" title="Chang, 1990 #1265">26</a>. Mixed gonadal  dysgenesis refers to the presence of a streak gonad on one side and a  dysplastic testis on the other. Some affected individuals have additional  features of Turner syndrome (dysmorphic features, congenital heart disease,  horseshoe kidney, impaired linear growth). The risk of germ cell tumours in the  gonads is high. Streak gonads should always be removed at diagnosis and if it  is decided to raise the child as a boy, the retained testis should be brought  down to the scrotum, closely monitored throughout childhood, and biopsied for  CAIS after the onset of puberty. If CAIS is detected, the testis should either  be removed or irradiated.<br>
    Approximately 25%  of patients with MGD have a uterus, which would allow them to bear a pregnancy  (with a donated egg). This may influence the decision about sex of rearing. The  risk of gender dysphoria is higher in this group than in the general population<a href="#_ENREF_27" title="Brinkmann, 2007 #2844">27</a> and more patients raised female are unhappy than those raised male. Male sex of  rearing appears to be a safer option, but the decision is always a difficult  one.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>45,X Turner syndrome</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A detailed  discussion about Turner syndrome is outside the scope of this chapter because  few patients require the attention of a urologist, unless they have urinary  obstruction related to a malformation of the kidneys and collecting system.

  <p>A small percentage  of children with Klinefelter syndrome is born with ambiguous genitalia<a href="#_ENREF_28" title="Lee, 2007 #75">28</a>. Klinefelter  syndrome is also associated with a degree of gender instability in some  patients. Although men with KS have dysgenetic testes (rarely larger than 6-10  mL) and high gonadotrophin levels, they do not appear to have a high risk of gonadal  cancers. The reason for this is unclear. Men with KS do, however, have an  increased of non-testicular germ cell tumours, particularly in the mediastinum,  and they also have an increased life time risk of breast cancer.<br>

The characteristic skeletal deformity is severe anterior bowing of both tibiae.<br>
      <strong>The investigation of an infant with ambiguous  genitalia</strong><br>
    Appropriate first-line investigation includes a full karyotype,  which can take a number of days, but it is helpful if the laboratory can  provide a rapid test to detect Y chromosome material.&nbsp; Where it is available, an urgently requested  fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) to detect Y chromosome sequences can  confirm the presence of Y chromosome material within hours. The probes used  vary according to what is being looked for, starting with a centromeric probe  to detect Y material in a 45,X patient and adding probes to SRY and  heterochromatin when there is the possibility of a structurally altered  chromosome. It should be noted that FISH is not used everywhere and many  laboratories would consider a rapid high resolution karyotype to be an  acceptable alternative. A pelvic ultrasound should also be urgently requested  for determination of internal genitalia. It should be noted that the accuracy  of this investigation is highly dependent on the skill and experience of the  sonographer and the availability of small probes. Measurement of serum  electrolytes, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, follicle stimulating  hormone and luteinizing hormone also constitute baseline investigations. Serum  anti-Mullerian hormone is recommended but is not widely available. Further  investigation is determined by the results of expert assessment and initial investigations.  These may include the hCG stimulation test to assess presence of functional  androgen-producing testicular tissue. The adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation  test can outline a steroid hormone biosynthetic defect affecting adrenal gland  as well as testis function. Urinary steroid profiling by gas chromatography and  mass spectrometry can outline the level of any enzyme defect in steroid  synthesis pathways, ideally using a 24 hour urine collection, but this test is  not available everywhere. Detailed imaging of the internal genitalia through  use of magnetic resonance imaging is used in some centres. A urogenital  sinugram to outline the anatomy of the lower genital tract is useful. In some  centres, gonadal biopsy to exclude pre-malignant or frankly malignant changes  would be performed in infants with Y chromosome material and ambiguous  genitalia, while in others, no biopsy would be performed until after the onset  of puberty. Molecular genetic testing for specific gene mutations is being increasingly  requested. Diagnostic algorithms are available to guide the use of these  investigations but despite the increasing sophistication of investigation  strategies, it is widespread experience that many infants with 46,XY DSD will  be left without a precise etiological diagnosis. <strong></strong><br>
  <strong>Risk analysis and management</strong><br>
    Before any surgery  is undertaken, infants and children with DSD must be considered to be at risk.  An infant with ambiguous genitalia, has, until proved otherwise, the risk of  death or severe illness from adrenal crisis associated with congenital adrenal  hyperplasia. If the infant has a Y chromosome, the risks include death in the  long term from gonadal germ cell cancer. The same infant has a high likelihood  of infertility and perhaps of hormone deficiency that could expose the person  to the risk of osteoporosis. If the labioscrotal folds are fused, there is a  risk of back-flow of urine into the vagina and recurrent urinary tract  infection, that could in turn cause kidney damage. An infant with 46,XY DSD  must be considered at risk of renal failure or Wilms tumour because they might  have either Denys-Drash or Frasier syndrome<a href="#_ENREF_31" title="Gwin, 2008 #2400">31</a>.  Any infant with ambiguous genitalia is at risk of gender dysphoria, even gender  identity disorder after reaching adolescence, or even before. The baby is at  risk of being neglected by its parents, if the parents have been traumatised by  the baby&rsquo;s birth and not given emotional support. <br>
    Surgery exposes  the child to additional risks: that the wrong operation will be done or that it  will be done badly, leading to urologic damage and impaired sexual function. <br>
    Clinicians caring  for infants and children with DSD are trained to assess the risks and the  magnitude of the risks. In each individual case, the preparation of a risk  management plan is an essential part of good management. The wide range of  risks cannot be adequately covered by one person and this is why  multi-disciplinary teams are able to provide the best care.</p>
  <p><strong>Ethical framework for decision making</strong><br>
    Decisions about  performing surgery to alter the appearance of the genitalia or to remove  gonadal tissue have profound implications for the person concerned and they  often need to be made long before it is possible to discern the person&rsquo;s gender  identity. The validity of parental consent for such procedures is being  challenged and some advocates argue that a decision to operate on an infant  with DSD should require authorization from a court of law. Even if this were to  become the accepted practice, the ethical issues would remain. The treatment that  would be in the best interests of the child would need to fulfil six ethical  principles<a href="#_ENREF_32" title="Gillam, 2010 #2788">32</a>. They are:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Minimization of physical harm to       the child</li>
    <li>Minimization of psycho-social harm       to the child</li>
    <li>Maximizing the chance of fertility</li>
    <li>Maximizing opportunities for satisfying       sexual relations, if desired</li>
    <li>Keeping options open for the       future</li>
    <li>Respecting the wishes and beliefs       of the parents</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These principles  are fully discussed elsewhere<a href="#_ENREF_32" title="Gillam, 2010 #2788">32</a>.<br>
      <strong>General counselling and support for parents and  patients</strong><br>
    Parents are  traumatized by the birth of an infant whose sex is unclear and they need the  help of an experienced mental health professional, who might be a social worker  or a psychologist, and who would help them to externalize their emotions, as  well as discuss how best to deal with friends and relatives. It is also  important to consider the family background and to identify any pre-existing  risk factors, such as fragile relationships, financial difficulty, lack of  support structures, substance abuse or mental illness. The treating team needs  to communicate well with one another and with the parents during the period in  which the sex is uncertain and while treatment is being started. Any  miscommunication, especially about the sex of the baby, can cause great  confusion and add to the trauma.</p>
  <p><strong>Surgery for ambiguous genitalia</strong><br>
    Many operations  have been devised to reduce clitoral size and the technical aspects will be  discussed elsewhere. Suffice to say there has been no systematic attempt to  evaluate these procedures in terms of their long term outcome results and a  multi-centre and broadly based study of this kind is long overdue. <br>
  <strong>Hormonal treatment for DSD</strong><br>
    A review of  hormones used in the treatment of DSD can be found elsewhere<a href="#_ENREF_33" title="Warne, 2005 #138">33</a>.  Patients whose gonads have been removed or whose gonads are not secreting enough  sex hormone are treated with the appropriate form of oestrogen (combined with a  progestogen when a uterus is present) or testosterone. Many different  preparations and modes of administration are available. Patients with adrenal  insufficiency are given hydrocortisone and, if necessary, fludrocortisone. <br>
  <strong>Genetic counselling, prenatal diagnosis and treatment</strong><br>
    All families with  a child who has a DSD need genetic counselling. The counselling would include  an explanation about the reason for their child&rsquo;s condition and a discussion  about the risk of them having another child with the same condition. In some  cases, it might also lead to the identification of other unsuspected cases in  the family. A child with CAIS, for example might have a younger sister or a  maternal aunt with the same condition. The geneticist might be able to identify  the specific mutation that caused the DSD in a child and this information might  allow prenatal diagnosis in the mother&rsquo;s next pregnancy, or if IVF was used,  pre-implantation diagnosis and embryo selection. Couples who have previously  had a child with 21-hydroxylase deficiency CAH have the option of choosing  prenatal treatment with dexamethasone in the mother&rsquo;s next pregnancy, aimed at  preventing masculinization of the genitalia in an affected female foetus.<br>
  <strong>Fertility</strong><br>
    Women with  congenital adrenal hyperplasia should have a good chance of fertility, given  that their ovaries are normal, provided the genital surgery allows them to be  able to have comfortable sexual intercourse. In practice, however, the  fertility rates in women with salt wasting CAH are quite low, for a range of  reasons<a href="#_ENREF_34" title="Trakakis, 2010 #727">34</a>. High levels of  progesterone inhibit gonadotrophin secretion. Ovaries may become polycystic.  The clitoris may have lost sensitivity. The vagina may be stenosed and dry,  preventing penetration. Psychologically, the woman with CAH may have either no  interest in sex, or be attracted to other women.<br>
    Fertility in 46,XY  DSD and sex chromosome aneuploidy DSD is rare and is usually assumed to be impossible.  This assumption, however, needs to be kept under critical review and all of the  advances that have been made in assisted reproductive technology should be  taken into account. It would be timely to undertake a full review of the  options that patients have, even considering what future developments in stem  cell technology and germ cell transplantation might be able to bring. The  amount of evidence about fertility in many rare conditions is far too small to  form the basis for clear recommendations. <br>
  <strong>Sexual function, sexual orientation</strong><br>
    It is unlikely  that for men or women who have had genital surgery as infants or children,  there is ever a perfect outcome. Many do establish satisfactory sexual  relationships but it is equally clear that many do not. Professional help, for  example, sexual counselling, should allow some of the difficulties that people  experience to be prevented. People with atypical genitalia are unsure about how  they can best achieve and give sexual pleasure. They need access to support that  would help them build self-esteem and establish healthy and intimate physical  relationships. The paediatric urologist, gynaecologist and psychologist or  sexual counsellor need to work together to achieve the best outcome for the  patient.<br>
  <strong>Gender identity, gender dysphoria, requests for sex  reassignment</strong><br>
    A technically  perfect operation resulting in cosmetically excellent genitalia does not  necessarily lead to a good outcome for the patient, if he or she is unable to  live in the gender that was assigned at birth. It is clear that the incidence  of gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder is considerably higher in DSD  patients than in the general community, especially in 46,XY DSD: PAIS, &nbsp;5a-reductase-2  deficiency and 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency being notable examples<a href="#_ENREF_35" title="Jurgensen, 2007 #76">35</a>. Knowledge that  gender dysphoria is a risk should lead surgeons to become much more  conservative about performing feminizing genitoplasty, which can really only be  justified in girls with CAH who have been diagnosed at birth and treated  adequately from the earliest stage.<br>
    Inevitably, some  patients with DSD will request sex reassignment and further surgery to reinforce  this after the onset of puberty. They should be referred to a psychologist or  psychiatrist familiar with gender identity disorder for a full evaluation which  will need to be made carefully and over time. In Australia, a decision to  proceed with any sex change surgery would require Family Court authorization  because parental consent would not be considered valid. Needless to say,  prevention is better than cure.<br>
  <strong>Long-term outcome studies</strong><br>
    Our own long term  outcome study of a mixed group of DSD patients whose surgical treatment was  provided by a stable team of clinicians at the Royal Children&rsquo;s Hospital  Melbourne reported that quality of life was equivalent to that in two  hospital-based control groups and that there was no evidence of major emotional  problems<a href="#_ENREF_36" title="Warne, 2005 #2846">36</a>.  Few patients reported major difficulties in sexual function. Six percent of  patients were dissatisfied with their gender as adults. These results were considered  to justify early genital surgery<a href="#_ENREF_37" title="Crawford, 2009 #2819">37</a>.<br>
    Many other long  term outcome studies have been published (reviewed by Warne in 2008<a href="#_ENREF_38" title="Warne, 2008 #13">38</a>). Conclusions  drawn from these studies have varied widely, for a number of reasons. Some  studies reviewed the outcome of surgery carried out by many different surgeons,  using different techniques, at different centres. Not surprisingly, the results  were inconsistent and in many cases, poor. Many of the studies have focused on  sexual function and gender identity, rather than on overall quality of life.  The risk of suicide and self-harm was highlighted by one study<a href="#_ENREF_39" title="Schutzmann, 2009 #2843">39</a>.<br>
    Genital surgery is  also surgery on the lower urinary tract and it is therefore not surprising that  many men and also women who had genital surgery as children continue to  experience significant urological and other health problems<a href="#_ENREF_40" title="Nermoen, 2010 #754">40</a>.<br>
  <strong>Controversy, debate, legal issues related to consent</strong><br>
    Some advocates in  Australia and other countries are calling for a moratorium on genital surgery  for infants with ambiguous genitalia. In Australia they have also urged  governments to make it mandatory for all cases to be referred to the court for  a judicial ruling. Some doctors and hospitals have been influenced by the  controversy and have actually brought several cases to court, establishing in  the process legal precedents that are binding on all practitioners in  Australia. The key issue that is in dispute is the validity of parental consent  for types of surgery that the advocates consider non-therapeutic. They argue  that &ldquo;cosmetic genital surgery&rdquo; is not necessary for the health of the infant  and can wait until the individual is able to make the decision. Few doctors  accept this argument and they justify the surgery on the grounds that it  prevents the psychosocial harm that would result from having to grow up with  ambiguous genitalia. The debate is far from over.<br>

  <p><strong>Optimal management &ndash; multi-disciplinary team, clinical  ethics response group, whole of life approach</strong><br>
    The consensus  guidelines for the management of DSD<a href="#_ENREF_1" title="Hughes, 2006 #118">1</a> recommend that all patients  should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, in a centre of excellence where  the genital surgery is done by paediatric urologists. A whole of life approach  is needed so that services are provided to meet the changing needs of patients  as they pass through adolescence, into adult life and beyond. In the past, the  needs of many patients were ignored and some adults with DSD have memories of  their earlier treatment that are extremely painful and which have made it  difficult for them to seek attention from doctors.<br>
  <strong>Support groups</strong><br>
    A large number of  patient support groups have been established around the world. They perform  very valuable roles by providing advocacy, liaison with health care  professionals, pastoral care, publishing information, allowing opportunities  for open-ended discussions with similarly affected people and families,  lobbying and fund raising.<br>
    There are also a  number of more political groups who are fighting for a cause on behalf of their  members, often in opposition to traditional medical views. They deserve credit  for stimulating a vigorous debate and a radical review of medical practice that  is still underway.&nbsp; </p>
