<div id="apDiv10">
  <p>Anorectal malformations represent a  spectrum of congenital abnormalities where the anus fails to open normally onto  the perineum 1 and it occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 live births  2.&nbsp; Persistent cloaca is the most severe type of anorectal malformation  encountered and is seen in girls where the rectum, urethra and vagina all fail  to develop and drain via a single abnormal channel onto the perineum 3. Cloaca accounts for around 10% of  all new ARM patients and despite the complexity of this group they are not  usually assessed separately 4.&nbsp;  Children with anorectal and cloaca malformations have a high incidence  of associated anomalies and the defect may occur as part of a syndrome such as  VACTERL (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, trachea-esophageal, renal and limb) or  caudal regression syndrome 5,6. The most commonly associated  anomalies include urinary tract, genitalia, vertebral anomalies including  sacrum as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal and central  nervous system 7,8.&nbsp; The  management of ARM patients has been a challenge for paediatric surgeons and  urologists and the most common and feared outcome is faecal incontinence. As  more long-term outcome data becomes available, it appears that urinary  incontinence, sexual dysfunction and fertility problems may also affect  patients born with anorectal defects. 9,10</p>
  <p><strong>EMBRYOLOGY</strong><br>
Infants with anorectal malformations  have a wide spectrum of disease with differing degrees of complexity 4.&nbsp; In accordance with the concept of caudal  regression, anomalous cloacal septation is associated with abnormal development  of other organ systems in close proximity such as the vertebrae, ureteral bud  dependent structures and mullerian duct derivatives 6.<br>
Regardless of the mechanism, it is  clear that septation of the cloaca and development of renal dysplasia are early  embryologial events. 11-13</p>
In cloacal malformation there is a common single  perineal opening for the genital, urinary and gastrointestinal tracts 14-15.&nbsp; Embryologically this confluence normally  persists until around 5 weeks&rsquo; gestation.&nbsp;  The cloaca is normally a transient structure during embryonic  development which forms from the developing tail fold at 3 weeks&rsquo; by the  confluence of the allantois and hindgut 16-18.&nbsp; In the past it was thought that partitioning  of the cloaca occured by the craniocaudal growth of a mesenchymal structure  called the urorectal septum and simultaneous migration of lateral indentations  close to the cloacal membrane (4-5 weeks&rsquo; gestation) 17-21&nbsp; </div>

  <p>However it is now reported that the mesenchyme between the hindgut and  the developing bladder appears to approach the cloacal plate but what was  previously thought to be the urorectal septum is created by the changes in  relative size and position of the mesnechymal structures surrounding the cloaca  as they grow 20-22.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the  sixth week the cloaca is divided resulting in a urogenital sinus anteriorly and  a separate hindgut posteriorly. The mesonephric ducts join the cloaca  laterally. They give rise to the developing ureteric bud, which in turn induces  kidney development from the metanephric blastema 16. The urethra  subsequently develops from the caudal end of the urogenital sinus after it&rsquo;s  separation from the cloaca 23.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anorectal malformations and persistent  cloaca may be due to arrest of division of the cloaca by mesechymal growth and  may occur at any stage in this process leading to a wide spectrum of anorectal  malformations 16,17. The intimate association of embryological  development of anorectal, genital and urinary systems also explains the  frequency with which simultaneous associated malformations in these systems  occur 4,15. &nbsp;As molecular  biology delivers more insights into the molecular triggers to development more  will be learned about the pathogenesis of ARM 20.</p>
  <p><strong>AETIOLOGY  &amp; GENETICS</strong></p>
  <p>The cause of ARM is unknown. The  molecular determinants during blastogenesis are overlapping for many body  systems so defects often involve two or more progenitor fields 24.  Sporadic ARM has been reported but it is more commonly found associated with  other systemic malformations 25. The genetics are complex as ARM  phenotypes result from multiple different genes 26.&nbsp; It may be that similar embryonic events that  produce oesophageal atresia are responsible for the ARM. In a mouse model the  SHH sonic hedgehog gene shows a relationship to both upper and lower GI  anomalies 27,28.</p>
  <p>ARM has been described in patients  with chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, trisomy 18, cat&rsquo;s eye  syndrome 13q.&nbsp; Cuschieri reported that  chromosomal abnormalities were found in 11% of a large series of European  infants with ARM. The frequencies of trisomy 21, 13 and 18 among this group of  infants was 15, 30, 90 times higher than the general population 29.  The teratogenic effect of chemicals such as thalidomide, oestrogen and ethanol  has also been described 30.</p>
  <p><strong>Genetic  syndromes - </strong>Many syndromes have been described with ARM as a feature. &nbsp;VACTERL, caudal regression and Currarino  syndromes will be outlined below but others such as CHARGE, Goldehhaar,  Renal-ear-anal-radial, Pallister Hall, Opitz ,&nbsp;  and Cat&rsquo;s eye syndrome have also been well described 30. <strong> </strong></p>
  <p>The <strong>VATER</strong> syndrome was first described by Quan and occurs in 1 in  5,000-10,000 livebirths and appears to represent a field defect 8.&nbsp; VACTERL is an acronym for vertebral  anomalies, anorectal malformation, cardiac anomalies, tracheoesophageal  fistula, renal anomalies and limb anomalies. Almost all cases of VACTERL are  sporadic so the recurrence risk for families is minimal.&nbsp; However in VACTERL patients with  hydrocephalus a mutation with PTEN gene has been reported 31. </p>
  <p><strong>Caudal  Regression syndrome</strong><br>
    This syndrome results from  failure of formation of part or all of the coccygeal, sacral, and occasionally  lumbar vertebral units and the corresponding segments of the caudal spinal  cord. It is commonly associated with ARM (27-48%) and genitourinary anomalies 32. Most cases of Caudal regression syndrome  are sporadic. However CRS occurs in 1% of pregnancies of diabetic women and 22%  of CRS patients have a history of maternal diabetes during pregnancy. Mothers  with insulin dependent diabetes are 200-400 times more likely to have a child  with CRS than a normal woman. 30,33 </p>
  <p><strong>Currarino Syndrome</strong><br>
    This triad was first  described as ARM with hemi sacrum and pre-sacral mass 34. Currarino syndrome can be sporadic with  autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and with variable penetrance 30. The HLXB9 gene on 7q39 has been identified  by linkage analysis as the causative gene 35. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">CLASSIFICATION OF ANORECTAL &amp; CLOACAL <br>
    MALFORMATIONS</p>
  <p>The term anorectal malformation has  come to represent a broad spectrum of abnormalities involving the termination  of the hindgut.&nbsp; Paediatric surgeons and  anatomists have tried to classify anorectal malformations in a rational way 36.  The terms&nbsp; &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; have been the  most widely accepted concept. The International classification 37  and Wingspread classification 38 proposed &ldquo;high&rdquo;, &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; and  &ldquo;low&rdquo; to classify ARM patients whereas Pena classifies the condition according  to the site of fistula, degree of caudal regression and therefore prognostic  outcome 39 (Table below )</p>

  <strong>Perineal  fistulas</strong> have  traditionally been called low defects in boys and girls where the rectum opens  in a small stenotic orifice always anterior to the centre of the anal  sphincter.<strong> <br>
  Figure 2</strong>
  <p><img src="text/fig2.jpg" alt="fig2" width="286" height="382"></p>
  <p><strong>Rectovestibular fistula</strong> is the most common defect seen in girls where the  rectum opens in the vestibule, which is the space between the hymen and the  perineal skin. Most have a good sacrum and anal sphincteric mechanism. </p>
<p><img src="text/fig3.jpg" alt="fig3" width="294" height="388"></p>
<p><strong>Rectourethral fistula</strong> is the most common defect in males. There are 2 types  : bulbar where the urethra opens in the lower posterior (bulbar) urethra and  prostatic fistula opens higher within the prostatic urethra. The latter has a  higher incidence of sacral dysplasia and poor anal sphincter muscle. </p>
<p><img src="text/fig4.jpg" alt="fig4" width="300" height="403"></p>
<p><strong>Rectovesical or rectobladder neck</strong> is the highest or most severe defect in males where  most patients have a sacral dysplasia, abnormal pelvic floor musclature and  anal sphincters. Surgical repair usually involves abdominal and posterior  saggital approach. </p>
<p><img src="text/fig5.jpg" alt="fig5" width="296" height="421"><img src="text/fig6.jpg" alt="fig6" width="302" height="385"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Imperforate  anus without fistula</strong> is rare with the rectum located usually 2 cm above the perineal skin. These  patients usually have a good sacrum and good anal sphincter muscles. </p>
<p><strong>Cloaca</strong><strong> </strong>is the most severe end of the spectrum of anorectal  malformations in females where urinary, genital and rectum all drain via a  common channel and single perineal opening. There is a high incidence of  associated sacral and urinary tract defects. Those with a short common channel  &lt; 3 cm can be repaired by posterior saggital approach. However those with a  long common cloacal channel represent a more complex defect which will usually  require combined abdominal and posterior saggital approach.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>ASSOCIATED  CONGENITAL ANOMALIES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The incidence of associated anomalies  in ARM patients may be as high as 60% with the genitourinary tract and spine  being most frequently affected 6, 15, 40-45.&nbsp; <br>
      <strong>VERTEBRAL AND SPINAL ABNORMALITIES</strong><br>
    A wide spectrum of lower lumbar and  sacral spine abnormalities which range from mild hyoplasia to complete absence  of vertebrae are found in patients with anorectal malformation 46,47.&nbsp; The occurrence of spinal, genitourinary and  anorectal defects together represents a regional defect or caudal regression  syndrome. These anomalies occur in a random pattern and in different degrees of  severity&nbsp; 42,48.</p>
  <p>Generalised sacral hypoplasia,  especially if mild may go unnoticed 46 as the sacral defect produces  little external deformity. The only visible physical signs are flattening and  asymmetry of the buttocks and poor development of the natal cleft 49.  There is usually no sensory defect and impaired motor function is limited to  the pelvic floor muscles. Later in life bladder and bowel dysfunction may be  the only sign of an underlying problem but this may be undetected and therefore  untreated in the preschool child.&nbsp;&nbsp; In  patients with anorectal malformation the presence of a sacral abnormality also  affects the functional outcome for faecal continence 1. Those patients  with sacral hypoplasia, hemivertebrae or fused vertebrae have a much poorer  outcome than those with a normal sacrum 36, 50. Pena proposed use of  the sacral ratio (sacral length in relation to fixed bony landmarks) as a  simple method to assess the sacrum although this method was untested in the  normal population.</p>
  <p>The neurological deficits in ARM patients have been thought to result  from defective sacral nerve root development. Many investigators have noted a  high prevalence of spinal cord anomalies when there is radiographic evidence of  a sacral abnormality 47,51,52. In infants under 3 months of age a  spinal ultrasound scan is effective at asses gross spinal cord anomalies and is  frequently used as a screening tool 53. The advent of Magnetic  Resonance Imaging (MRI) has enabled non invasive evaluation of the spinal cord  in this group of patients and incidences of spinal cord abnormality range from  24% 50 to 50% 54. The prevalence of spinal cord  abnormalities was increased in the more severe ARMs and in those with  urogenital abnormalities. </p>
  <p><strong>CARDIAC</strong><br>
    Cardiovascular malformations occur in  12-22% of ARM patients <strong>2, 29</strong>. The most common lesions are  tetralogy of Fallot and ventricular septal defects. Transposition of the great  arteries and hypoplastic left heart syndrome have been reported but are rare <strong>29</strong>.<strong></strong></p>
  <p>TOF/OESOPHGEAL  ATRESIA<br>
    Many GI  malformations have been described in association with imperforate anus. Up to  10% of patients have tracheoesophageal abnormalities 29. Duodenal obstruction due to annular pancreas or duodenal atresia  occurs in a small percentage of patients. Malrotation with Ladd bands that  causes obstruction has also been described.&nbsp;  Hirschsprung disease has been well described in association with imperforate  anus, although the incidence of this combined condition is unknown 29, 30. </p>

  <p><strong>GENITOURINARY  TRACT</strong><br>
    Genitourinary anomalies occur frequently in patients with ARM and  previous retrospective reviews report incidences from 20 to 50% 1,6,15,41,42.The  importance of investigating and treating the urinary tract in patients born  with anorectal malformations has until recently been underemphasized 56.&nbsp; Overall, approximately 40% of patients have a  urinary tract anomaly and 10% have a genital anomaly1,6,15, 44, 57.&nbsp; <strong>Table  2</strong> below<br>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fistulas between the anorectum and  urogenital tract are the most commonly encountered problem and occur in 95% of  patients 1, 6. Most patients with a fistula require a diverting  colostomy within the first few days of life prior to reconstructive surgery 58.Urinary  tract abnormalities may significantly influence the clinical outcome of these  patients 6,40.&nbsp; Abnormalities  of the upper tracts may be responsible for primary renal impairment in patients  with dysplasia or agenesis and secondary renal impairment can develop in  patients with undetected abnormalities such as pelviureteric junction  obstruction or vesicoureteric junction obstruction 57. In one large  series from Toronto,  14% of ARM patients had bilateral renal abnormalities on presentation 6.  Vesicoureteric reflux is a common problem in ARM patients and reflux  nephropathy also represents a preventable cause of renal deterioration 57. </p>
  <p>The incidence of urinary anomalies increases according to the severity  of the ARM 10,44,  59. Rich and Pena  noticed a close correlation between the level of the rectal fistula and the  frequency and severity of the associated urological malformation 15.  In high malformations such as cloaca and bladder neck fistula there was a 90%  incidence of genitourinary abnormalities whereas there was a 14% incidence in  low anomalies 57. It has also been suggested that those with a  lumbosacral bony abnormality or a genital abnormality have an increased risk of  associated renal abnormality 15, 44. </p>
  <p>The mortality rate from renal  insufficiency in ARM patients is 6% 6, so the importance of  urological evaluation in all new ARM babies cannot be overemphasised. Common  and preventable complications can then be avoided. Continued long-term  follow-up is mandatory to monitor the upper tracts and also to exclude  neurogenic bladder.</p>
  <p><strong>Genital  abnormalities</strong> are  very common in both male and female ARM patients. In one series 52% of boys had  abnormalities  of the genitalia including hypospadias, bifid scrotum, bilateral undescended  testes, or penoscrotal transposition 6. The presence of a genital abnormality in boys with  ARM appears to be associated with a renal abnormality. Cryptorchidism is a common  finding and the incidence varies between 10 and 40% of male ARM patients 6,44,57. McLorie  reports that this is more common in high versus low malformations (27% vs7%).&nbsp; A penile abnormality has been described in  14&ndash;25 % of male ARM patients 44,57. Hypospadias is the most common  penile abnormality detected, but chordee, epispadias and penile duplication  have also been reported in a few patients 44. A bifid scrotum commonly occurs and is oftenwith  the more severe variants of hypospadias and penoscrotal transposition has also  been described. 6 </p>
  <p>Mullerian  abnormalities occur in 30&ndash;45 % of girls with ARM 55,60,61. Cloacal  anomalies are characterized by a confluence of the urethra, vagina, and rectum  into a single channel, or persistent cloaca with a solitary opening on the  perineum 62. This anomaly occurs as a result of a complex defect of  perineal development, and is associated with maldevelopment of the Mullerian  tubercle, sinovaginal bulbs, vaginal plate, and urogenital sinus. The resulting  abnormalities show great variation depending on whether the confluence is high  or low 57,62. Some degree of septation of the uterus and vagina,  ranging from a partial septum in a large vagina with single cervix and uterus  to a completely separated double vagina with double cervix and uteri, is seen  in 60% of cloaca patients 10,57,62,63. Abnormalities of the external  genitalia are rare, but hamartomas and hemangiomas of the labia majora have  both been observed.</p>

    <h2>SURGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF  ANORECTAL </h2>
    <h2>&amp; CLOACAL MALFORMATIONS</h2>
    <p>Reports of absent anus were documented  in Greco-Roman times and Soranos of Ephesus was the first to describe finger  disruption of an anal membrane 36.&nbsp;  From the fifteen to eighteenth century numerous reports appeared and  treatment involved blind perforation of the perineum with a trocar 64, 65.  Bodenhamer in 1860 made a clear distinction between low (anal) and high  (rectal) anomalies 65.&nbsp; In the  late 19th century perineal and sacroperineal approaches were  developed which involved anatomical dissection of the rectal pouch rather than  blind puncture 66,67 and reduced surgical mortality from 90% to 40%  in the early 20th century 68,69.</p>
    <p>Cloacal malformations for many years  were called imperforate anus with urogenital sinus 70.&nbsp; The patient therefore usually had surgical  treatment for the imperforate anus and the urogenital sinus portion would not  be dealt with until a later date. It is only within the past 30 years that the  surgical treatment for cloaca has evolved and this coincided with a new  understanding of anorectal malfomations and the development of new surgical  techniques 71.<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
      Historically the surgical approach to  anorectal malformations was rather empirical. The low defects were treated by  simple perineal operations however more complex high defects, where the rectum  was more than 1 cm from the skin, most surgeons treated with an  abdominoperineal repair pulling the rectum quite posterior in an attempt to  avoid injury to urogenital structures 36.&nbsp; Stephens with his pioneering scientific study  of these defects in the 1960s suggested it was important to preserve an  important part of the levator muscle, the puborectalis 37, 69,,  which involved placement of the rectum close to urethra and vagina and  dissection via combined sacral and perineal approach.&nbsp; This procedure however involves a blind step  which is usually related to a crucial area around the bladder neck, posterior  urethra, seminal vesicles and vas.&nbsp;  Considering that both posterior urethra and posterior vagina share a  common wall with the rectum and it is difficult to separate one from the other,  even under direct vision, this might explain some of the post-op complications  encountered with this technique 68. The posterior saggital  anorectoplasty (PSARP) 71,72 described by Pena and de Vries in 1982,  allows the operating surgeon direct exposure to the anatomy of the anorectal  malformation with excellent views of the fistula in most cases. This  significantly lessens the risk of iatrogenic damage to important pelvic  structures 10. </p>
    <p><strong>NEWBORN  MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
    <p>When a new infant is born with ARM  then clinical examination of the perineum yields important clues about the  level of the management. Decisions can then be made regarding ongoing surgical  management. It is important to wait 24 hours if possible before deciding whether  a colostomy is necessary as it can take time for enough pressure to build up  within the rectum and meconium to drain via a fistula. Meconium can drain  directly onto perineum or via the urinary stream in infants with rectourinary  tract fistula.&nbsp; Clinical examination also  allows inspection of the cardiovascular system, spine and genitalia to detect  associated anomalies. </p>
    <p>In the first 48 hours it is usual for  the child to be administered intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics. A  nasogastric tube is essential to decompress the bowel and will also exclude the  presence of oesophageal atresia. An echocardiogram is essential to detect  structural cardiac defects before general anaesthesia. A plain radiograph  especially in the lateral position is recommended by some authors to help  determine the level of the defect 10. Ultrasound is a reliable and  non invasive way to image the urinary tract and spine at a convenient time. </p>
    <p>In infants with a perineal fistula it  is common to perform an anoplasty in the first 48 hours of life 9,10.&nbsp; For the remainder of defects then a  protective colostomy is fashioned to decompress the gut and definitive surgery  can then be planned when the infant is older and anatomy of the defect  confirmed. Some institutions may opt to perform a neonatal repair without  colostomy but this is not recommended unless the surgeon has extensive  experience in this field 9,10, 36. <br>
      A colostomy can be performed with low  morbidity even in a sick or premature infant. A split or divided colostomy is preferred  to a loop stoma as it prevents overspill of stool into the distal colon. Most  surgeons place the stoma in proximal sigmoid or descending colon as this leaves  adequate length of distal colon to for mobilisation of the rectum during the  pull through procedure10, 36,58 Once the stoma is fashioned, the  infant can feed normally and thrive.&nbsp; A  distal colostogram can then be performed which is essential for detecting the  level of the fistula to the urinary tract and planning the reconstructive  surgery.&nbsp; A stoma also has the benefit of  protecting the definitive repair until the area has healed. 10, 58<br>
      In girls with persistent cloaca it is  useful to perform an endoscopy, at time of colostomy formation, to assess the  internal anatomy and determine the length of the common cloacal channel. In  some cloaca patients it may also be necessary to create more effective drainage  of the urinary tract 73.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>DEFINITIVE SURGICAL REPAIR</strong></p>
<p>Although many repairs have been described  in the past, most surgeons now use the posterior saggital approach to repair  anorectal malformations with or without laparotomy or laparoscopy.&nbsp; The repair is most commonly performed at  around 2-4 months but this depends on local practice and clinical status of the  infant.<br>
      <strong>THE  POSTERIOR SAGGITAL ANORECTOPLASTY (PSARP)</strong><br>
    The PSARP begins by opening the area  between the mid sacrum and the external sphincter through a midline saggital  incision with the patient in the prone position. The appropriate site for the  anus is determined by an electrostimulator. All muscle structures are separated  precisely in the midline. The bowel is mobilised, opened and the fistula  identified. The fistula is then divided, tied off and the intestine  meticulously separated from the urinary tract or vagina. The surgeon must then  dissect the bowel to gain enough length to suture it to the skin. The  saggitally split muscle complex including levator and the external sphincter  are then re-approximated dorsal to the bowel and the muscle coat of the bowel  sutured circumferentially to the surrounding external sphincter to create a  neoanus 71,72. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>This approach allows for direct visualisation of the  anatomy and gives the surgeon the best opportunity to preserve important  anatomic structures including the urethra, vagina, prostate, vas, seminal  vesicles and the nerves necessary for urinary control and sexual potency. The  most important part of the operation is represented by the separation of the  rectum from the genitourinary structures. Most of the time there is a common  wall with no natural plane of dissection creating 2 walls out of one and  preserving both structures as much as possible. There are now adolescent  patients with complications such as urethral strictures, urinary incontinence  and sexual impotence 74.</p>
  <p><strong>LAPAROSCOPIC  PROCEDURE</strong></p>
  <p>The goals of the laparoscopic  pull-through include allowing precise placement of the rectum though the  external sphincters without dividing the sphincter complex and diminishing perirectal  scarring 75. Laparoscopy and subsequent dissection gives good  exposure for high urethral and bladder neck fistulae. The fistula can then be  divided by loop ligatures before division 75. Transperineal  dissection is performed once the sphincters have been mapped externally using  an electrostimulator. After appropriate dissection a trocar is intoduced from  below under direct vision by laparoscope. The rectum is then delivered down  onto the perineum allowing external anatamosis 75.<br>
      <strong>THE&nbsp; VARIANTS OF PSARP&nbsp; FOR&nbsp;  REPAIR OF CLOACA. </strong><br>
    The most challenging surgical  reconstruction in the spectrum of ARM is that of persisent cloaca involving  correction of the urogenital defect in addition to the anorectal pull-through.  The lower defects with a short common channel are amenable to repair by the  posterior saggital or perineal approach however those with a long common  channel are much more complex and continue to present a challenge to the  operating surgeon. Traditionally the approach was to repair the rectal  component and leave the urogenital component until a later date 76.  Hendren and Pena both advocate simultaneous repair of all 3 components either  by abdominoperineal or abdominal and pasterior saggital approach&nbsp; 77,78.</p>
  <p><strong>Posterior  saggital anorecto vaginourethroplasty (PSARVUP)</strong></p>
  <p>Using the posterior saggital anorecto  vaginourethroplasty (PSARVUP) the cloaca can be repaired by complete separation  of the three structures 77. As described in the previous section the  rectum is identified by posterior saggital approach and dissected from the  vagina. The anterior vaginal wall is then meticulously dissected from the  urinary tract and both rectum and vagina are mobilised from below (and above  where necessary) before being placed in their normal positions. The previous  common channel is used to create a neourethra 77.&nbsp; <br>
    In cases of a long common channel the  vagina may be too short to anastamose to the perineum so additional skin flaps  or intestinal replacement had to be used to create a vagina 79.<br>
  <strong>TOTAL UROGENITAL MOBILISATION</strong><br>
    Pena in 1997 described the technique  of Total Urogenital Mobilisation for repair of cloacal malformations. This  surgical manoeuvre has reduced operative time considerably and simplified the  procedure. In this modification the rectum is separated from the vagina via the  posterior saggital approach and then the entire urogenital sinus is dissected  and mobilised en bloc 80.&nbsp; The  dissection proceeds laterally and anteriorly to the urethra and vagina in a  circumferential manner. Avascular ligaments attaching the urethra and vagina to  the pelvic brim are divided and the dissection continues around the vagina,  anterior wall of the bladder and urethra until enough length has been gained to  connect the vaginal edges and urethra to the perineum 80.&nbsp; &nbsp;In  cases of a long common cloacal channel a combined abdominal, posterior saggital  approach with total urogenital approach may be necessary. Other surgeons have  now used this technique and modifications for the repair of a persistent  urogenital sinus 81-83.</p>
  <p><strong>REDO  SURGERY</strong></p>
  <p>There are 2 main indications for redo surgery: poor  functional control or post operative complication such as leak, recurrent  fistula or rectal prolapse 10,84. Candidates  for second PSARP must have malpositioned rectum with good<br>
    prognostic features. The posterior saggital transanorectal  approach may also be used when correcting misdiagnosed cloaca with  non-mobilised urogenital sinus. 84 </p>
  <p><strong>OUTCOMES</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Faecal continence</strong></p>
  <p>Children  with ARM have a complex, structural developmental abnormality. Whilst surgical  intervention aims to correct the malformation, most patients who undergo  surgery have some degree of a functional defecating disorder. Faecal continence  depends on three main factors: sphincters, sensation, and motility.&nbsp; Most patients with anorectal malformation  have a disturbance of this sophisticated bowel motility mechanism. 85<br>
    Continence is defined as voluntary bowel movements with  minimal soiling. The continence rates vary depending on presenting anatomy and  associated malformations. A tethered spinal cord or another spinal  malformation, such as hemivertebrae or spinal dysraphism, may significantly  increase the risk of incontinence 9,10,86.&nbsp; Surgical complications also decreases the  chances for primary continence, although this is difficult to quantify.  Reoperation significantly decreases the opportunity for primarily continence 84,86.<br>
    Total  continence has been reported as Perineal fistula 90%, rectovestibular fistula  70%, bulbar 50%, prostatic 30%, cloaca long common channel 27% and bladder neck  12% 9,10,85,86.&nbsp; Distention of  the rectum seems to be felt by many of these patients, provided the rectum has  been located accurately within the muscle structures. This sensation seems to  be a consequence of stretching the voluntary muscle (proprioception). The most  important clinical implication of this is that liquid stool or soft faecal  material may not be felt by the patient with anorectal malformations, as the  rectum is not distended 86. Thus, to achieve some degree of  sensation and bowel control, the patient must have the capacity to form solid  stool. Bowel motility is perhaps the most important factor in faecal  continence.</p>
  <p>Constipation is very frequent problem for ARM patients with  incidence of 22-68% 10,  36, 85.  A distended  hypoperistaltic colon&nbsp; eventually leads  to more severe constipation (Megarectum). &nbsp;9,85 The enormously  dilated rectosigmoid behaves like in a myopathic type of hypomotility disorder  but has normal ganglion cells on biopsy. The  patients with faecal incontinence who have constipation  can be treated with enemas 36,69,86. In some patients with  poor muscle complex or colonic resection they have no rectal reservoir and  often loose stools. This is a situation  equivalent to a perineal colostomy 88.&nbsp; In these cases, medical management consists of enemas plus a constipating  diet and medications to slow down the colonic  motility 10,86. <br>
    The best determination for future continence is  observation of function as the child grows and matures. A child who constantly  leaks stool will probably not improve by school age and may benefit from early  bowel management. However if a child is able to hold stool it is best to  observe as the child develops bowel function. Regardless of what the child will  be capable of in the future, it is important to establish a bowel management  regimen that the family or child can cope with independently.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Renal</strong> <br>
There  are no studies reporting renal function in prospective cohorts of patients with  ARM. &nbsp;However Misra described 4 of 95  patients who had chronic renal failure; the underlying diagnosis was bilateral  renal dysplasia, bilateral vesicoureteric reflux, and neuropathic bladder.&nbsp; Patients with chronic renal failure (defined  as a glomerular filtration rate, GFR - corrected for surface area- of less than  80 ml/min) have been described in both low and high anomalies. One patients  required renal transplantation before 18 years of age 87. The  incidence of chronic renal failure in patients with high lesions is not well  documented, but between 2 and 6% of these patients die from renal  insufficiency, compared with 1.1% with low lesions 6. The management  of chronic renal failure and end-stage disease in children with ARM raises  specific challenges. Peritoneal dialysis and subsequent renal transplantation  can be difficult due to the previous abdominal operations. In addition, those  patients who go on to renal transplantation need careful assessment to exclude  neuropathic bladder, which could continue compromise the new kidney. 57</p>
  <p><strong>Urinary  Continence</strong></p>
  <p>The aetiology  of lower urinary tract dysfunction in ARM and cloacal anomalies is poorly  understood 50. However, bladder dysfunction causes significant  urological morbidity in the paediatric population, resulting in renal damage  from recurrent urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence, both of which  can cause profound morbidity and disability 88. Recurrent urinary  tract infection maybe overlooked or attributed to coexisting vesicoureteric  reflux or renal anomalies, which are prevalent in a high proportion of these  children 6,88. Consequently,detecting bladder dysfunction at an  early age is essential in avoiding deterioration in renal function 56,  88,89 </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  overall incidence of bladder dysfunction as assessed by urodynamics has been  reported as between 7 and 30% 90, 91. The majority of children with  bladder dysfunction had abnormal spine or spinal cord 92.&nbsp; This was confirmed by Warne, who  prospectively studied a group of 45 ARM patients by natural filling urodynamics  and found that 58% of ARM patients and 83% of cloaca patients had bladder  dysfunction on presentation 90.</p>
  <p>Unlike  fecal incontinence, urinary incontinence impacts on the kidneys. Incontinence  caused by a neurogenic bladder may be associated with recurrent urinary tract  infections and vesicoureteric reflux. This combination can result in ongoing  damage to the kidneys, resulting in renal failure 6,93.  Consequently, the early aggressive management of these patients is important to  prevent renal damage. The important factors are to ensure that the bladder is  emptied regularly and that the intravesical pressure remains low. Bladder  emptying, when necessary, is best performed by clean intermittent  catheterization (CIC). CIC can be performed either urethrally or via a  Mitrofanoff stoma 88 . In the majority of patients with an ARM the  urethra is sensate, consequently urethral CIC can be uncomfortable, especially  in the older patient. Medical management with anticholinergic agents is the  first line of treatment but if this fails bladder augmentation may be necessary  57. These techniques can be used to achieve social continence in  many of the patients.</p>
  <p><strong>Adult  Outcomes &ndash; Sexual function &amp; Psychology</strong></p>
  <p>With  improved surgical techniques these children have relatively normal lives with a  good life expectancy. Paediatric literature tends to concentrate on continence  outcomes but as these patients reach adolescence and adulthood then  psychosocial and sexual function also become important.<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  <strong>Males</strong><br>
    Impaired  sexual function has been reported in adult male patients who have undergone  surgical procedures in the prostatic area at the time of anoplasty 94.&nbsp; Fertility has always been reported in terms  of paternity and literature for this group is sparse. Sub Fertility may be  multi factorial and due to cryptochidism, genital anomalies, sacral anomalies  or iatrogenic injuries 94. Holt et al who investigated 20 adult ARM  patients for infertility found that iatrogenic injury at pull-through surgery  accounted for half the cases 95. </p>
  <p><strong>Females</strong><br>
    In  adolescence it is important to assess females born with ARM. Levitt reports  that 10% of the girls with rectovestibular fistula in Pena&rsquo;s series had vaginal  atresia 96. A further 7% had a vaginal septum requiring surgical  intervention 96.&nbsp; This  highlights the importance of reassessing all cloaca patients and female ARMs  pre menarche to avoid complications at the onset of menses. All cloaca patients  have undergone some form of vaginal reconstruction and a review of 21 adult  patients showed that 86% had an adequate vagina and no menstrual difficulties  and 57% were sexually active 62. There are case reports in the  literature of normal pregnancy and vaginal delivery in ARM patients 97.</p>
  <p><strong>Psychology</strong><br>
    In  some publications Bowel and urinary outcomes in adults appear to be worse than  suggested in paediatric reports, with high levels of both urinary and faecal  incontinence 98. A high ARM was associated with a greater degree of  incontinence. Both men and women scored more poorly than controls on the body  esteem, sexual well-being and quality-of-life assessments. Urinary and bowel  incontinence was associated with poorer sexual well-being 98.&nbsp; Poorer outcomes appeared to affect sexual  well-being adversely 98.&nbsp; It  is therefore important for future ARM patients to have multidisciplinary care  during this transition from childhood to adulthood.&nbsp; At this stage concerns about sexual function  and well-being can be addressed which are central to an acceptable quality of  life.</p>
  <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br>
Management  of anorectal malformations requires an accurate diagnosis at presentation,  correct neonatal management with either primary anoplasty or defunctioning  colostomy together with treatment of associated malformations.<br>
An  anatomical reconstruction at the appropriate time is vital. Postoperatively the  management should be multidisciplinary. If the child does not achieve normal  continence then early intervention by bowel and bladder management programs and  bladder an understanding lead to a child that is clean and dry with an  excellent quality of life, because he or she either possesses the capacity for  continence or can be kept artificially clean. Long-term follow up of these  patients into adolescence and adulthood is important to treat ongoing problems  and support the patient psychologically as he/she develops.</p>
