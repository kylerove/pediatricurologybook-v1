  <p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common childhood condition. This chapter discusses the diagnosis and management of UTIs in children, as well as the potential need for further investigations to diagnose underlying structural anomalies, vesicoureteric reflux or dysfunctional voiding in a child presenting with a UTI.</p>
  <p><strong>Genetics/Etiology</strong></p>
  <p>Overall, prepubertal girls have a higher risk of UTI than  boys, but under a year of age, the incidence of UTI is higher in boys. </p>
  <p>The incidence of UTI in girls is estimated to be 3% and in  boys around 1% [<a href="#ENREF_1">1</a>]. Up to 7% of girls and 2% of boys will  have a culture-proven symptomatic UTI by age 6 years [<a href="#ENREF_2">2</a>]. </p>
  <p>The risk of UTI also varies between different age groups. In  uncircumcised infant males the incidence of UTI is 0.7%, higher than the  0.1-0.4% reported incidence in infant females [<a href="#ENREF_1">1</a>]. The  risk of UTI increases after infancy in females to 0.9-1.4% before age 5, and to  0.7-2.3% in school age girls. In contrast, the risk of UTI drops in males after  infancy to 0.1-0.2% under age 5 and 0.04-0.2% in school age boys. </p>
  <p>The incidence of UTI is noted to be higher in Caucasian  girls and lower in African-American children [<a href="#ENREF_1">1</a>].<br>

  <p><strong>Physiology/Pathophysiology</strong></p>
  <p>The pathogenesis of UTI involves an interplay between host  factors as well as virulent properties of the causative pathogens. A UTI is  most commonly due to ascent of bacteria from the perineum into the urinary  tract, but seeding of the urinary tract can occur haematogenously as well [<a href="#ENREF_3">3</a>]. Bacteria can be introduced iatrogenically with  instrumentation of the urinary tract in surgery; or with catheters and stents  within the urinary system. </p>
  <p>Host factors that increase the risk of UTI include:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Obstructive uropathies leading to       impairment of drainage and stagnation of urine such as posterior urethral       valves, pelviureteric junction obstruction or vesicoureteric junction       obstruction </li>
    <li>Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR)</li>
    <li>Functional abnormalities such as       dysfunctional voiding and constipation, termed &lsquo;dysfunctional elimination&rsquo;</li>
    <li>Neurogenic bladder</li>
    <li>Urolithiasis</li>
    <li>Catheter and stent use</li>
    <li>Structural anomalies of the renal       tract such as ureteroceles, multicystic dysplastic kidney or urachal       remnants</li>
    <li>Host immune compromise and       comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Causative organisms display a variety of virulence factors  that predispose to UTIs. <em>E coli</em> is  the commonest pathogen causing UTIs in children, cultured in over 80% of cases  [<a href="#ENREF_4">4</a>]. <em>E coli</em> strains  have adhesins such as <em>P fimbriae</em> and <em>Dr haemagglutinin</em> that enable attachment  to host proteins. Other pathogens that commonly cause UTI include Proteus,  Klebsiella and Enterococcus. Proteus organisms have the ability to &lsquo;swarm&rsquo; and  rapidly advance along the surfaces of catheters and stents [<a href="#ENREF_5">5</a>]. </p>
  <p>Less common pathogens causing UTI include Pseudomonas and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and these are  considered atypical UTIs [<a href="#ENREF_6">6</a>]. Neonates have  relatively higher rates of Group B Streptococcus UTI [<a href="#ENREF_7">7</a>].</p>
  <p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
  <p>The presentation of children with UTI varies greatly with  age. Preverbal children usually present generally unwell with non-specific  signs such as lethargy, fever, vomiting and irritability. Up to 5-13% of  febrile children presenting to the emergency department will have a UTI, so one  must always consider a UTI in the febrile child [<a href="#ENREF_8">8</a>]. </p>
  <p>Older children may localise symptoms to the urinary tract  and present with suprapubic pain, dysuria, frequency or loin pain. </p>
  <p>As always, the history of the presenting complaint is a  guide to diagnosing a potential UTI. Other specific points must be sought in  the history to assess for possible underlying predisposing conditions. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Antenatal history</em></strong></p>
  <p>For numerous reasons, antenatal records are often not  available. If possible, it is helpful to know whether there is a history of  fetal hydroureteronephrosis or bladder abnormality,. as this &nbsp;may suggest a structural anomaly or underlying  severe vesicoureteric reflux. </p>
  <p><strong><em>History of previous UTIs</em></strong></p>
  <p>Were these culture positive or treated on clinical suspicion  only? What were the organisms cultured? Did the child require admission to  hospital? Did the child undergo investigations after the UTI was diagnosed and  treated and what did the investigations show?</p>
  <p><strong><em>History of predisposing conditions such as renal stones,  spina bifida or congenital abnormalities</em></strong></p>
  <p>Children with neurogenic bladders from spina bifida often  self-catheterize, and thus may be predisposed to UTIs. Children with a history  of renal or bladder stones likewise may present with UTI.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Urinary stream, voiding pattern</em></strong></p>
  <p>Children with bladder dysfunction have an increased risk of  UTI [<a href="#ENREF_9">9</a>]. Children with bladder overactivity,  detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, infrequent voiding or incomplete voiding are at  increased risk of UTI [<a href="#ENREF_10">10</a>]. Posterior urethral valves should be  suspected in male infants with poor stream.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Constipation</em></strong></p>
  <p>Constipation is often present in children who have recurrent  UTIs. There is an association between constipation, dysfunctional voiding,  recurrent UTIs and VUR in children [<a href="#ENREF_11">11</a>]. One or all of  these components may be present. They are often described under the title of  &lsquo;dysfunctional elimination&rsquo; or &lsquo;dysfunctional elimination syndromes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p><strong><em>Family history of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR)</em></strong></p>
  <p>Pure primary vesicoureteric reflux may be present and may be  an underlying factor in the child with UTI. If present, and in the presence of  febrile UTIs, there is evidence that surgical intervention to correct the VUR  will reduce the risk of pyleonephritis [<a href="#ENREF_12">12</a>].</p>
  <p><strong><em>Physical Examination</em></strong><br>
    In addition to a standard physical examination, the examination  should include looking for loin tenderness, a palpable bladder or kidneys and  the appearance of the external genitalia. Labial adhesions in females and  congenital megaprepuce in males may be predisposing factors. The back should be  inspected for evidence of occult spina bifida.&nbsp;  The lower limbs and peri-anal area examined for subtle signs of  neuropathy such as wasting of the calf muscles or absent an-cutaneous reflex.</p>
  <p><strong>Investigations</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Investigations to confirm diagnosis of UTI</em></strong></p>
  <p>The diagnosis of UTI is usually confirmed on a urine sample  sent for microscopy, culture and sensitivities (MCS). The acutely unwell baby  or infant with fever is best referred to the emergency department of a  secondary or tertiary paediatric centre, where a full septic screen is  performed. In an infant too young to void on command, the gold standard  specimen is a suprapubic aspirate of urine. If a suprapubic sample is not  possible to obtain, a catheter specimen may be taken. Urine should be sent for  urgent microscopy and culture in the unwell young infant. Bacteria seen on microscopy  are 93% sensitive and 95% specific for a UTI [<a href="#ENREF_13">13</a>].</p>
  <p>A bag specimen has a high false positive rate due to  contamination from the skin. A bag specimen is useful to exclude a UTI if the  collected urine is culture negative [<a href="#ENREF_7">7</a>]. </p>
  <p>In an older child able to void on command, as much as  possible, a urine sample should be obtained as a clean catch mid-stream urine.  If a clean catch cannot be obtained, a suprapubic aspirate or catheter specimen  should be obtained. In the older child with localised signs and symptoms of  UTI, urine is sent for routine microscopy, culture and sensitivities.</p>
  <p>Ward urinalyses are not very sensitive or specific for  confirming the diagnosis of UTI. One should be suspicious of UTI if bacteria,  protein and white cells are present on the urinalysis. Positive nitrites on a  dipstick are 99% specific in predicting a UTI, but if nitrites are negative,  they are only 60% sensitive in ruling out a UTI [<a href="#ENREF_13">13</a>].</p>
  <p>A culture with a pure growth of more than 100,000 colony  forming units per ml is generally considered a UTI, especially if supported by  the presence of white cells in the urine on microscopy [<a href="#ENREF_14">14</a>]. <br>

  <p><strong><em>Investigations recommended in a child with proven initial  UTI</em></strong></p>
  <p>Studies suggest that 21-50% of children with a UTI will have  an underlying abnormality.&nbsp; About 10% of  children presenting with a UTI will have an abnormal ultrasound finding which  may or may not affect management [<a href="#ENREF_15">15</a>, <a href="#ENREF_16">16</a>].  This includes abnormalities such as pelviureteric junction obstruction,  vesicoureteric junction obstruction and posterior urethral valves in boys. For  this reason, we recommend that all children presenting with an initial UTI  should undergo renal ultrasound.</p>
  <p>A renal ultrasound after initial UTI should be performed  even if there is a history of normal antenatal ultrasound scans.</p>
  <p>Up to 30% of children presenting with a UTI will have  underlying vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) [<a href="#ENREF_15">15</a>, <a href="#ENREF_16">16</a>]. 90% of this VUR is of lower grades, I to III. Ultrasound  scans are not useful for assessing for the presence or grade of VUR. A micturating  cystourethrogram (MCU) is the most useful test to assess for and grade VUR. An  MCU is performed by catheterizing the bladder and filling it with contrast,  followed by a voiding phase. Sedation may be required in some cases. </p>
  <p>VUR and UTIs are associated with renal damage and scarring.  It is estimated that 5% of children presenting with UTI will have associated  renal scarring [<a href="#ENREF_17">17</a>]. Delay in diagnosis and treatment of  UTIs, and recurrent UTIs correlate more with renal scarring. However, it is now  well known that renal scarring in children with VUR may be present even before  a clinical UTI, suggesting pre-existing scarring or dysplasia of the kidney.  This is especially common in young male infants with VUR. On the other hand,  children with VUR and recurrent UTIs may not acquire renal scarring; whilst  some children with no proven VUR may acquire renal scarring after UTIs.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>With these variations, it is difficult to obtain data about  the true risks of UTIs and the true role of associated VUR in the development  of renal scarring. </p>
  <p>The American Urological Association still recommends renal  ultrasound and MCU for all children presenting with their first UTI between  ages of 2 months and 2 years. When significant VUR is found operative treatment  options include either endoscopic ureteric injection or open ureteric  reimplantation [<a href="#ENREF_18">18</a>]. </p>
  <p>The Royal College of Physicians in the UK in 1991  recommended screening children under 1 year of age with a renal ultrasound and MCU  as well as a dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) after a first UTI [<a href="#ENREF_19">19</a>]. The more recent UK NICE guidelines from 2007 have changed  this traditional view. In essence, the guidelines recommend imaging after a  first UTI in children should be more directed and selective, based on the age  of the child, whether the UTI was typical or atypical and the response to  treatment.&nbsp; One must remember that  guidelines such as NICE are guides and are not meant to be prescriptive, so  individual cases must be dealt with on their merits.</p>
  <p>There are no set guidelines in Australia, and Australian  practice in terms of imaging children after their first UTI varies from centre  to centre and practitioner to practitioner [<a href="#ENREF_20">20</a>]. </p>
  <p>Our recommendation currently is to always obtain a renal  ultrasound after an initial UTI. An MCU should also be obtained in the  following situations:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Known anomaly on antenatal       ultrasound scan &ndash; especially if dilated ureters are visible, or bladder or       urethral abnormality is suspected</li>
    <li>Abnormality noted on the post-UTI       renal ultrasound</li>
    <li>Strong family history of VUR and       reflux nephropathy</li>
    <li>Recurrent UTIs </li>
    <li>Atypical UTI organism</li>
    <li>Severe UTI requiring IV       antibiotics</li>
    <li>Geographical factors &ndash; it would be       prudent to perform an MCU in children who have been diagnosed with a UTI       who live in rural and remote and have to travel long distances to       specialist health care</li>
    <li>In any boy with any degree of       bilateral hydronephrosis, or history of poor stream or voiding       difficulties, to exclude the possibility of posterior urethral valves</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A DMSA scan is performed in children who have documented VUR  on MCU or the appearance of renal scarring suggested on renal ultrasound. The  DMSA scan will give a clear idea of differential renal function and distribution  of renal scarring. The timing of the DMSA is crucial.&nbsp; If done when the child is unwell DMSA can  help to diagnose pyelonephritis and later to detect renal scarring.</p>
  <p><strong>Non-operative Management</strong></p>
  <p>Antibiotics are the mainstay of UTI management. In most  children, broad spectrum antibiotics can be started once cultures have been  collected, and then tailored according to the sensitivities once the results  are obtained. Sick febrile children with clinically suspected upper tract  infections often need admission to hospital for treatment with intravenous  antibiotics. Children with suspected cystitis often can be managed with oral  antibiotics. A proof of treatment urine culture obtained a week or two after  treatment is of no proven benefit in the asymptomatic patient.</p>
  <p><strong>Interventional Radiology Management or  Operative Management</strong></p>
  <p>Infection in the setting of obstructive uropathies (such as  posterior urethral valves, PUJO or obstructed upper pole and ureter secondary  to a ureterocele) often requires good drainage of the obstructed system in  addition to the antibiotic treatment. This is especially important in the  setting of pyonephrosis, where the child&rsquo;s clinical behavior is similar to one  having an abcess with high swinging temperatures. </p>
  <p>Drainage of the urinary tract can be facilitated by: </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Urethral catheters, such as in       posterior urethral valves</li>
    <li>Internal drainage using JJ stents,       such as in VUJO or PUJO </li>
    <li>External drainage using a       nephrostomy tube such as in pyonephrosis secondary to PUJO </li>
    <li>Formal stomas such as vesicostomy,       ureterostomy or pyelostomy </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The decision of how best to drain the infected obstructed  system depends on the clinical circumstances of the child, and is usually made  by the urologist after examination of the patient and review of relevant  images.</p>
  <p><strong>Managing VUR and UTIs</strong></p>
  <p>Low grade VUR has a high chance of spontaneous resolution.  For higher grade VUR, parents are usually given the choice of watching and  waiting for possible spontaneous resolution, with or without prophylactic  antibiotics, versus upfront surgical intervention.</p>
  <p>Data from the Cochrane Review shows a 50% reduction in the  risk of febrile UTIs in children after surgical treatment for VUR [<a href="#ENREF_12">12</a>]. Surgical treatment options for VUR include:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Endoscopic injection of ureteric       orifice with substances like Deflux or Vantris gel. This has an 80%       success rate in correcting VUR with one injection. It is done as day-case       surgery under general anaesthetic and injection can be repeated if VUR       persists or recurs.</li>
    <li>Open surgical ureteric       reimplantation. This has a 98%+ success rate in correcting VUR. It       involves a small suprapubic incision and 1-3 days in hospital recovering.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Prognosis, Outcome, Complications</strong></p>
  <p>Generally, the prognosis after a childhood UTI is good.  30-50% of children after an initial UTI will get a further UTI. Most of these  recurrences occur within 3-6 months of the original UTI [<a href="#ENREF_21">21</a>].  Underlying predisposing structural and functional factors must be sought for  and treated accordingly.</p>
  <p>5% of children will have renal scarring evident when  diagnosed with their initial UTI [<a href="#ENREF_17">17</a>]. Whilst it is well  established that these scars are likely to be congenital, there is also good  evidence for acquired scarring associated with VUR and UTIs. Long-term studies  show that 12% of those with childhood UTIs have renal scarring, with the number  increasing to 25% in those with recurrent UTIs [<a href="#ENREF_22">22</a>, <a href="#ENREF_23">23</a>]. </p>
  <p>Renal scarring is further associated with hypertension or  renal failure. In one long-term study of children with renal scarring after  pyelonephritis in childhood, the risk of hypertension was 23% and of renal  failure 10% [<a href="#ENREF_24">24</a>]. </p>
  <p>As acquired renal scarring seems to correlate most with  delayed diagnosis and treatment of UTI, the key to scar prevention is quick  clinical diagnosis of UTI and early instigation of appropriate treatment [<a href="#ENREF_22">22</a>]. </p>
  <p>There is some evidence that pregnant women who have renal  scarring secondary to childhood UTI are more at risk of complications such as  bacteriuria, acute pyelonephritis, hypertension and pre-eclampsia [<a href="#ENREF_25">25</a>].</p>
  <p><strong>UTI Prevention</strong><br>
Commonly recommended practices to minimize the risk of UTIs  include:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Prophylactic antibiotics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Up to now,  there was no strong evidence to support the role of prophylactic antibiotics  after a single UTI in preventing recurrences. A recent Australian randomized  controlled trial is the first to definitively show a reduction in the risk of  UTIs in the 12 months after the index UTI in the group of children placed on  daily trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. However, the protective effect seemed to  drop off with time, and the long-term benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in  children with UTIs remains unproven [<a href="#ENREF_6">6</a>].</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Managing dysfunctional       elimination&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Dysfunctional  voiding with raised post-void residual urine volumes and constipation are  associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections and hence must be  carefully investigated and managed, particularly in children who present with  recurrent UTIs [<a href="#ENREF_26">26</a>].</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Cranberry </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cranberry  contains anthocyanidin/proanthocyanidin moieties that are potent antiadhesion  compounds and thought to prevent I and P-fimbriated uropathogens such as <em>E coli</em> from adhering to the urothelium.  There is randomized evidence that cranberry helps reduce the risk of recurrent  UTIs in adult women, and its value in children is extrapolated but not proven [<a href="#ENREF_27">27</a>].</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Probiotics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are  thought to promote the balance of bowel organisms in favour of non-pathogenic  commensals.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Circumcision in male infants</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Studies  suggest that circumcised boys have a 10-fold lower risk of UTI compared with  uncircumcised boys [<a href="#ENREF_28">28</a>, <a href="#ENREF_29">29</a>].  However, there is no evidence to recommend circumcision for all boys after a  first UTI. Circumcision is certainly considered in boys who experience  recurrent UTIs and/or have underlying urinary tract anomalies such as posterior  urethral valves or VUR.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Drinking plenty of fluids</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is to  maintain regular voiding and flushing of the urinary tract.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Good toileting habits </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These include  regular voids (every 3 hours), relaxed seated posture for girls with feet  supported and hips abducted and wiping the perianal area away from urogenital  area.<br>
