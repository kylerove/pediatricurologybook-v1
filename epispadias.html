    <li>Definition  and pathophysiology </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Epispadias  is a congenital anomaly of the urethra and the genital tubercle which belongs  to the exstrophy/ epispadias complex (EEC). During the first 2 months of  gestation, the embryo (germinal disc) is subjected to a complex process  (delimitation) [1] of cranio-caudal tubularization  resulting in the cavitation and connection of the pelvic organs to the pelvic  floor. This leads to the creation of urinary, genital and intestinal cavities  independently connected to the perineal surface by distinct conduits and their  corresponding sphincter. If the delimitation process is interrupted early, the  distal bowels, the bladder and the urethra are not individualized and appear as  contiguous and often duplicated plates. This is a cloacal exstrophy which is  rare (1:250 000 births) and often associated with other abnormalities. If the  process halts a bit later in the gestation, the bowels are properly formed and  connected but the bladder and urethra are both widely open. This results in a  classical bladder exstrophy which is the most common presentation of the EEC  although still quite rare (1:10-50 000 births). Finally, when the process stops  late, only the urethra and the urethral sphincter are open and incompetent.  This results in an epispadias which is much rarer than the classical bladder  exstrophy (1:117 000 births) [2]. Depending on the timing of the  cavitation failure, one may distinguish posterior epispadias involving the  sphincteric mechanisms and various degrees of incontinence, from anterior  epispadias where the continence mechanisms are completely or partially  respected but the genital tubercle remains abnormal. Epispadias exists both in  boys and girls with a clear predominance in the male gender.<br>
    Complex  embryonic hypotheses have been described to explain these abnormalities. They  involve the formation and positioning of the cloacal membrane with is situated  at the caudal end of the germinal disc and occupies the infra-umbilical  abdominal wall. Between the 2 layers (ectoderm and endoderm) initially forming  the cloacal membrane comes a mesenchymal ingrowth [3] which will result in the formation  of the lower abdominal muscles and the pelvic bones [4]. The surrounding mesoderm will be  at the origin of the genital tubercle. The 3D development of the embryo  progresses from the cephalic to the caudal extremity, and from the dorsum to  the ventrum of the embryo. When the caudal delimitation is aborted, the  mesenchymal ingrowth between the ectodermal and endodermal layers fails to  progress and the overstretched cloacal membrane becomes fragile and subject to  a premature rupture leading to exstrophy (or non-cavitation) of the pelvic  organs [5]. This &ldquo;zip down&rdquo; process&nbsp; [2] explains the progressive closure of  the pelvis and the cavitation of the pelvic organs from the back to the front  and from the top to the bottom of the embryo. It is possible that the middle  period of the cloacal delimitation is more vulnerable than the early and late  stages. This would explain why bladder exstrophy is mEpidemiological  data confirmed that the incidence of bladder exstrophy is between 2.15 and 3.3  per 100&nbsp;000 births [11, 12]) whereas epispadias was 2.4 per  100&nbsp;000 with a sex ratio quite variable from almost even [11] to a marked male predominance of  5:1 [13]. White children, in vitro  fertilization [14] and&nbsp;  socioeconomic status seem to be interacting factors. Significant genetic  predisposition remains uncertain considering the small reported cohorts [15-17]. The recurrence risk varies from  0.3% [18] to 2.3% [16] [17] [15].ore frequent than cloacal  exstrophy and epispadias [6]. Other embryonic hypotheses have  been reported&nbsp; [7] [8-10].<br>

    <li>Anatomical  and clinical presentation:</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The  description given hereunder is limited to the epispadiac penis itself.  Associated urologic and non-urological pelvic anomalies often found with the  exstrophy patient are detailed in another chapter.</p>
  <ol>
  <ol>
  <ul>
    <li>In  boys: The urethral plate is wide open along the dorsum of the penis on a  variable length. The extent of exposed urethral mucosa can vary from the dorsum  of the glans for anterior epispadias to the whole urethra and bladder neck for  posterior epispadias. The penis may look short and is almost always bent  dorsally due to the malrotation of the corpora cavernosa. In isolated  epispadias, the pelvic bony cavity is usually normal although an interpubic gap  may exist which shows that the EEC anomalies are in fact a continuum. When  associated with a bladder exstrophy, the epispadiac penis appears foreshortened  because of the wide separation of the corporal insertions [19, 20]. The displacement of each  hemipelvis leads to a malrotation of each corpus, explaining the dorsal  curvature of the erect penis; the flaccid epispadiac penis does not dangle. The  corpora cavernosa are also shorter than in normal men especially in the  exstrophy group [21]. The erection mechanisms are preserved  but sexual intercourse is rendered impossible by the size and shape of the  erect penis.&nbsp; The hooded foreskin is only  present on the ventral side of the penis although a complete foreskin may be  seen in epispadiac penis. The corpus spongiosum is only present under the  urethral plate which is itself often wide and healthy contrary to what is often  found in hypospadiac penis where it can be hypoplastic [2]. Up to recently, it was thought  that the nerves leading to the glans were essentially represented by 2  neurovascular bundles running along the dorso-lateral sides of the corpora  cavernosa.&nbsp; The work done by Baskin [22] demonstrated that the neurological  fibres leading to the glans (and the clitoris) are spread around a large  surface covering&nbsp; the lateral aspects of  the corpora and are probably less individualized than previously thought. In  the epispadiac penis, the routes taken by the nerves are a bit more lateral due  to the malrotation of the corpora. A better understanding of the anatomy of the  nerves has significantly changed the way these nerves are separated from the  corpora and the urethral plate. No vascular anastomosis exist between the  epispadiac corpora which allows their full separation during repair. The veru  montanum and the seminal tracts are normal [23], provided they are not injured  iatrogenically. In posterior epispadias, retrograde ejaculation may occur as  the sphincteric mechanisms are in essence defective. In epispadias following  exstrophy closure, the prostate is only present posterior to the urethral  plate. The testicles are normal although frequently located near the pubic  tubercles, above the corresponding scrotum which usually appears wide and  stretched.&nbsp; Duplicated urethra and penis  have been reported [24] with exstrophy.</li>
  </ul>
      <ol>
      <ol>
      <ul>
        <li>In  girls, the clitoris is bifid. The urethral plate is wide open up to the level  of the bladder neck. The vagina is normal in isolated female epispadias as well  as the bony pelvis. A hairless area separates the two hemimons pubis. The labia  are divergent. The uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries are normal except for  occasional uterine duplication. In case of exstrophy where the vagina opening  is anteriorly positioned, often stenotic, the vaginal conduit is horizontal. </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Surgery  of epispadias</li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Surgical repair of these genital anomalies are usually performed during  the first two years of life.</p>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>In  boys: The aims of this surgery are 1) to correct the dorsal curvature of the penis  by rotating the corpora cavernosa to obtain a dangling penis; 2) to relocate  the reconstructed urethra on the ventral side of the penis; 3) to redistribute  the skin around the penis to compensate the dorsal skin defect.&nbsp; Although many procedures have been described  over the years [25, 26] [27], the techniques of Ransley [28] ,Mitchell [29]  and Kelly [30] are probably the most  commonly used these days. Preoperative  androgen stimulation of the genital tubercle makes surgery easier.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>In  Ransley&rsquo;s technique, the incision begins in the midline above the urethral  opening and is extended far enough upwards to provide good access to the  proximal corpora for mobilization.Figure 1 It continues down on each side of  the urethral plate (backed by the corpus spongiosum) and sweeps ventrally  around the coronal sulcus separating the prepuce and ventral skin from the  corpora.&nbsp; Once the ventral aspects of the  corpora are fully exposed. The fascia covering each corpus&nbsp; is vertically opened&nbsp; all along the ventral aspect of each corpus.  This maneuver allows exposure of the albuginea of each corpus. Dissection  continues under the fascia around the albuginea of each corpus medially to  separate the vascular tissues (spongiosum) leading to the urethral plate, and  externally to separate the wide strip of neurological fibers innervating the  glans. Each neurovascular bundle and the urethral plate with its spongiosal  tissue are then separated from adjacent structures.&nbsp; Figure 2.&nbsp;  The urethral plate is tubularized and a MAGPI type plasty (IPGAM) of its  distal end allows ventralization of the future urethral meatus. The corpora are  then rotated medially by approximately 90&deg; and maintained in this new  configuration by a proximal caverno-cavernostomy.&nbsp; This new anastomosis between the corpora  keeps the urethra in its ventral position and gives the penis a dangling  position when flaccid. The skin shaft cover is performed with a transverse flap  of ventral skin dissected with its pedicle and transfer to the dorsal side of  the penis (reverse Duckett).Figure 3</li>
            <li>Mitchell&rsquo;s technique [29,  31]   is based on a complete disassembly of the penile structures which allows a  tubularization and ventralization of the entire urethra, and a more complete  release of the corporal rotation. The corpora cavernosa are completely separated from each other with  their corresponding hemi glans. The urethral plate is dissected off of the  corporeal bodies respecting&nbsp; its blood  supply coming from underneath. It is then tubularized and transferred  ventrally. The corpora entirely separated and independent are rotated to  correct the dorsal chordee and sutured together. The glans halves are  subsequently brought together.</li>
            <li>The  Kelly procedure or radical soft tissue mobilization is used by some [32, 33] for exstrophy closure. The  technique is described elsewhere[30] and may be a valuable alternative for primary  or secondary penile reconstruction in EEC patients. The periostium on the inner  side of the ischium and pubis with the attachment of the sphincter muscles, the  pudendal vessels and nerves are mobilized on both sides so that the outstretched  muscles can help to reconstitute the membranous urethra without osteotomy. Others  [34] have suggested a mobilization of  the crura from the pubic rami to get more penile length without the complete  Kelly mobilization</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;.&nbsp; </p>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>In  girls, the open urethral plate extending from the bladder neck to the medial  aspect of both hemi-clitoris anteriorly, and to the anterior vaginal edge  posteriorly, is separated from the adjacent structures up into the perineal  muscles and subsequently tubularized (Figure 4 ). The triangular hairless area  separating both hemi-pubis is excised (Figure 5). The perineal muscles located  in front of and between the neo-urethral conduit and the vaginal orifice are  both sutured together which significantly increases the bladder outlet  resistance and provides social continence in most cases(Figure 6). A secondary  plasty of the mons venus may be needed at puberty if the cosmetic appearance of  this area remains unsatisfactory. It is recommended not to dissect and suture  together both medial aspects of the two hemi-clitoris to avoid any damage of  the clitoral sensitivity [35]. </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Incontinence  surgery: </li>
      </ol>
      <p>As mentioned before, the degree of incontinence is quite variable in  epispadiac patients. It is essentially in posterior epispadias where the  sphincteric mechanisms are impaired that complementary treatments are  discussed.&nbsp; All procedures aim at  increasing the bladder outlet resistance to achieve social dryness (&gt; 3  hours) and allowing bladder emptying either via the reconstructed urethra or  via a continent conduit (Mitrofanoff) [36]. Continence which implies complex,  coordinated active neuromuscular mechanisms cannot be achieved by conventional  surgery. Surgery can only create a sufficient static obstacle which, in the  best cases, allows the child to hold urine for at least 3 hours without  significant leakage. This is dryness which implies passive mechanisms not  always easily controllable. </p>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>The  peri-cervical injection of biocompatible substance: It is the simplest option  to increase the outlet resistance by injecting a bulking agent in the bladder  neck region.&nbsp; Although not very invasive  this procedure provides disappointing results on a medium and long-term basis.  The most optimistic results [37] report 30% to 40% of dryness with  several years of follow-up. Although immediate results can be encouraging,  continuous deterioration with increased leakage is common. It does not seem  that the type of bulking agents used makes a significant difference.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>The  cervico-cystoplasty / bladder neck reconstruction:</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      This  surgery is usually performed in incontinent epispadias after the age of 3 or 4  years when some collaboration between the child and the medical team can be  established and when the bladder capacity is big enough (&gt; 80 ml). It is the  most hazardous part of this reconstruction as it aims at increasing the bladder  outlet resistance to achieve intervals of dryness of at least 3 hours without  compromising complete bladder emptying and upper tract drainage. Experience  shows that this challenge is rarely achieved in the exstrophy group although  results are better in the epispadiac group as the bladder behavior is probably  more normal. A full description of the Young-Dees-Leadbetter cervicocystoplasty  is done in the exstrophy chapter.&nbsp; This  technique often leads to &ldquo;obstructive&rdquo; micturitions i.e. high pressure emptying  which represents a threat for the bladder and the whole upper tracts. Trigonal  dissection can also damage the genital tracts. These patients often have poor  or retrograde ejaculations related to the deficient sphincteric area.<br>

          <li>The  artificial urinary sphincter: Insertion of an artificial sphincter cuff around  the EEC bladder neck has had poor results although individual experience is  always limited. There is a much higher risk of erosion in a reconstructed  bladder neck and urethra. The artificial sphincter is therefore not a front  line solution in the EEC group although silicone sheath placement has been  reported to facilitate the insertion of the cuff in selected patients [38, 39] .</li>

          <li>The  bladder neck closure:</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>It is the ultimate  solution when all others have failed. It is a difficult operation as these  tissues have been previously dissected the separation of the trigone from the  bladder neck region can be tricky. This procedure although quite successful in  term of dryness is irreversible and obviously implies a concomitant Mitrofanoff  diversion.</p>
      <ol>
      <ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Complementary  procedures: The unpredictible results of cervico-cystoplasty often lead to a  combined Mitrofanoff continent diversion which allows complete, regular and low  pressure bladder emptying [36]. If the bladder capacity does not  increase after urethroplasty, it is sometime necessary to augment the bladder  capacity with a bowel segment. Finally, most EEC bladders are associated with  reflux which is usually corrected at the time of the cervicocystoplasty. We  will not describe here diversions of urine towards the distal colon [40] and their variants (Mainz Pouch II)  which have the advantage of reducing the number of operations and achieving a  reasonable level of continence although expose patients to a high risk of  severe retrograde urinary infection and bowel cancer [41].</li>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Reported results are usually better in the epispadiac group compared to  the exstrophy group and better in girls than in boys. Cosmetically, the outcome  is satisfactory in girls [42] <br>
        although complementary surgery of the mons pubis may be requested at  puberty. The repaired epispadiac penis is often short and broad with better  result in isolated epispadias compared to the exstrophy group.&nbsp; Undoubtedly the Cantwell-Ransley penile  repair has been a major step forward not only in the surgical outcome but also  in the understanding of this condition [43-47]. The Mitchell penile disassembly [29, 31, 48-50] provides equivalent results with  possibly a higher risk of glans or hemi-glans necrosis. The Kelly procedure has  strong supporters who have a solid experience of this difficult dissection  associated with a significant risk of penile loss [33, 51]. Skin coverage of the reconstructed  epispadiac penis aims at transferring ventral skin to the dorsum. The  post-operative cosmetic appearance may often be disappointing with a penis  which often looks small and buried. Attempts to improve this have been reported  [52].</p>

        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Functionally the primary reconstruction of the urethra in both sexes is  an essential first step which allows the bladder to grow. In the Baltimore  group [53], social dryness was achieved in  approximately 75% of their exstrophy females compared to a 87.5% of dry  patients 15 years earlier [54]. Our long-term results [55], and those of others [56] and [57] clearly showed a long-term  deterioration of dryness as well as serious complications related to  &ldquo;obstructive&rdquo; micturitions (infections, stones, bladder perforation, upper  tract dilatation) mostly in the exstrophy group. In our own series of 25  incontinent epispadias dryness was achieved day and night in 28%, day only &gt;  3 hours in 24%, between 1 and 3 hours in 16% and less than 1 hour in 8%. These  results were better in this group than in the exstrophy group (80 patients) where  only 45% presented with a dry interval of &gt; 3 hours with transurethral  voiding. Complications related to &ldquo;obstructive micturition&rdquo; and other  complications were also significant with 48% of recurrent urinary tract  infections (vs.65% in the exstrophy group), 8% of stone (vs. 24%), 20% of upper  urinary tract dilatation (vs. 26%), 4% of bladder perforation (vs. 16%), 1  patient with adenocarcinoma in both groups [55].  Simplification of the  technique of bladder neck plasty has been reported [58]. The key issue is the growth of the  bladder after increasing the outlet resistance. The epispadiac bladder has a  much safer behavior and therefore a better dryness outcome than the exstrophy  bladder which is essentially abnormal [59]. The role of endoscopic injection  remains uncertain as published series are short, retrospective and often mix  neurological bladder and EEC. It might be helpful to treat partial urinary  incontinence and to help bladder growth. Redo bladder neck is an even greater  challenge with little success in our series [43, 55] leading to other technical  adjustments [60] using bladder neck wraparound.<br>

        <li>Sexual  and psychological dysfunctions are significantly high in the EEC patients with  a lesser degree in the pure epispadiac group. Female patients probably have a  better adjustment to this handicap than males whose repaired penis is often  short and broad with preserved erections but poor ejaculations [61-64].</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Conclusion</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Epispadias is a complex  and rare malformation of the genital tubercle which requires a very challenging  surgical reconstruction to achieve acceptable cosmetic and functional results.  Its rarity has led to the suggestion that these patients should be referred to  a limited number of expert centers for management. Current management of  epispadias usually starts with a urethral reconstruction to increase the outlet  resistance and to let the bladder grow. In some cases (mainly in girls) this  sole procedure may be sufficient to achieve social dryness. If not, an attempt  to use injections of bulking agents around the bladder neck might be  temporarily helpful.&nbsp; On a long-term  basis, bladder neck reconstruction associated with anti-reflux surgery is the  classical approach knowing that the outcome of this surgery is unpredictable  with a significant morbidity. Bladder neck closure is the ultimate solution  especially in boys despite long-term complications. Outcomes in adolescents and  adults and large series are lacking which should encourage prospective  multicentric studies.</p>
