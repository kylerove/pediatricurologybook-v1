    <li><strong>Introduction</strong>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Cryptorchidism (undescended testis) is  the most common disorder of the male endocrine glands in children [1,2]. The main  reasons advocated for treatment of cryptorchidism are increased infertility in  unilateral and bilateral cryptorchid patients, increased testicular malignancy  rate, an increased risk of developing testicular torsion, injury against the  pubic bone, and the possible psychological stigma of an empty scrotum. The  current standard of therapy in the United States has been the surgical  repositioning of the testis within the scrotal sac (orchiopexy), while initial  hormonal manipulation has been more widely used in Europe.  Despite successful relocation of the testis, long term sequelae of  cryptorchidism may occur, including infertility, subfertility, and malignancy.</li>
    <li>&ldquo;The American  Urological Association released a guideline that reviewed over 700 articles  covering the evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism.&rdquo; &nbsp;https://www.auanet.org/education/guidelines/cryptorchidism.cfm</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Epidemiology</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Three percent of full-term boys and up  to 45% of preterm males have cryptorchidism [3]. This  percentage falls to 1% by 3 months of age. There are two peaks for detection of  undescended testes: at birth, and at 5 to 7 years of age. The latter group  probably represents those patients with low undescended testes (&ldquo;ascending  testes&rdquo;) that become apparent with linear body growth. Bilateral undescended  testes occur in 10% of patients with cryptorchidism. Unilateral anorchia is  found in 5% of patients. An undescended testis is one that does not remain at  the bottom of the scrotum after the cremaster muscle has been fatigued by  overstretching. This is commonly confused with a retractile testis, one that  may not always lie in the scrotum, but that will stay in the bottom of the  scrotum after overstretching the cremaster muscle. Advanced maternal age,  maternal obesity, diabetes, or consumption of cola-containing drinks during pregnancy,  family history of cryptorchidism, prematurity, breech presentation,&nbsp; and low birth weight/small for gestational  age have all been suggested as possible risk factors for cryptorchidism [4,5].</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Normal testicular descent occurs during  the seventh month of gestation. The majority of testes that will descend  spontaneously do so by 3 months of age, possibly due to the normal gonadotropin  surge (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) that  occurs around 60-90 days of life and is responsible for maturation of the germ  cells [6,7,8,9]. Gendrel et  al [7] and Job et  al [9] reported  blunting of this surge in boys with cryptorchidism that remain undescended in  the first year of life.&nbsp; They  demonstrated a significant difference in the polynomial regression curves  comparing the testosterone levels of persistently cryptorchid testes with those  having delayed spontaneous descent. Many boys with cryptorchidism have lower  morning urinary LH and a decreased LH/FSH response to gonadotropin-releasing  hormone, corresponding to the abnormal germ cell development in both the  undescended and contralateral descended testis. Without this surge, Leydig  cells do not proliferate, testosterone does not increase, germ cells do not  mature, and infertility may result. This suggests that a mild endocrinopathy is  responsible, and cryptorchidism may be a variant of hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism. However, the positive predictive value that bilateral  cryptorchidism will have abnormally low testosterone levels is only about 23% [9].&nbsp; Subsequent studies have been inconsistent,  with reduced [10] or normal [12] serum  testosterone levels and normal [10,11] or  relatively increased [12] relative LH  levels, when comparing cryptorchid patients with controls. </li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The undescended testis fails to show  normal maturation at both 3 months and 5 years of age.&nbsp; At 3 months of age, the fetal gonocytes are  transformed into adult dark (Ad) spermatogonia. At 5 years of age, the Ad spermatogonia  become primary spermatocytes. Both of these steps are abnormal in the  undescended testis, and to a lesser extent, the contralateral descended testis.  Previous theories that the undescended testis was normal between birth and 1  year of age are incorrect, since these theories were derived from counts of all  germ cells without taking into account whether maturation was occurring. After  2 years of age, thermal effects on the testis being left out of position are  seen independent of the endocrinologic effects. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Etiology</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Of all boys with undescended testes, 4%  of their fathers and 6-10% of their brothers also have undescended testes.  Though a genetic susceptibility for cryptorchidism is suggested, the etiology  is likely polygenic and multifactorial. Schnack et al reviewed over 1 million  male births and demonstrated that risk ratios for cryptorchidism were 10.1 in  twins, 3.5 in brothers, and 2.3 in offspring of fathers who had an undescended  testis [13]. Previous  data on this subject suggested 5-fold increased risk in offspring of affected  fathers and 7- to 10-fold increased risk in those with an affected brother as  compared to patients with no family history of the disorder [14,15,16].</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The possibility that environmental chemicals  alter normal reproductive tract development has been debated in the  literature.&nbsp; There is significant  potential concern that endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be linked to the  &ldquo;testicular dysgenesis syndrome&rdquo; [17.18].&nbsp; Concerns for a connection between endocrine-disrupting  chemical and cryptorchidism developed because of a reported higher risk related  to early maternal exposure to diethylstilbestrol [19].&nbsp; Currently, indirect correlations and  suggestive data have been found correlating exposure to endocrine-disrupting  chemicals such as pesticides, flame retardants, and phthalates and the  occurrence of cryptorchidism [20-24].&nbsp; Some question whether epidemiologic data  truly support the existence of a clinical testicular dysgenesis syndrome [25].</p>
  <p>The hormonal pathways that are crucial for  testicular descent have been mainly studied in animal models.&nbsp; Some observers feel the species have  sufficient similarity to warrant translational studies of these models [26].&nbsp; Based on murine models, Hutson has proposed  that testicular descent occurs in two phases [27].&nbsp; The initial transabdominal descent  accompanied by enlargement of the gubernaculum is controlled by the Leydig cell  hormone insulin-like 3 (INSL3) [28,29].&nbsp; Transgenic mice with deletion of <em>Insl3</em> are viable but show a severe cryptorchidism phenotype [30,31], suggesting the crucial nature  of INSL3 in the process of testicular descent.&nbsp;  In addition, these mice have developmental abnormalities of the  gubernaculum, abnormal spermatogenesis and infertility. In human fetuses,  Leydig cell production of INSL3 peaks at 15-17 weeks&rsquo; gestation just after the  peak in testosterone production at 14-16 weeks&rsquo; gestation. In vitro, these  hormones cause proliferation of gubernacular cells [29,32].&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal models suggest that inguinoscrotal  descent is androgen-mediated, via the genitofemoral nerve (GFN) and/or by  activation of androgen receptors in the gubernaculum [27,28].&nbsp; The GFN releases calcitonin gene-related  peptide (CGRP) upon stimulation to produce rhythmic contractions of the murine  gubernaculum, which aids migration of the testis and gubernaculum into the  scrotum.&nbsp; In addition, androgens may also  alter the composition of the gubernaculum resulting in the appropriate swelling  and elasticity that promotes testicular descent through the masculinized  inguinal canal [28].&nbsp; Indeed, cryptorchidism has been noted in  rodent models exposed to androgen receptor blockade, with defective innervation  (the cryptorchid TS rat) and/or with altered muscle-specific gene expression in  the gubernaculum (the Long-Evans orl rat) [33,34].&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<p>The role for androgens in testicular descent  is readily observed in clinical human correlates.&nbsp; Cryptorchidism is a common component of  complete or partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS, PAIS) due to  mutations of the androgen receptor (<em>AR</em>) gene [35].&nbsp; The role of <em>AR</em> gene mutations in isolated forms of hypospadias or cryptorchidism  is less clear.&nbsp; Analysis of this gene in  males with isolated cryptorchidism suggests that longer alleles of the GGN  (polyglycine) repeat polymorphism are more common in cases as compared to  controls but no association of CAG (cytosine-adenosine-quanine) repeat length  or variants in other <em>AR </em>exons with isolated cryptorchidism [35-40].</p>
  <p>Several investigators have examined the role  of genetic variants of <em>INSL3</em> and its  receptor, <em>RXFP2 </em>(relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 2, also  known <em>LGR8 </em>and <em>GREAT) </em>in the etiology of cryptorchidism.&nbsp; Binding of the INSL3 protein to RXFP2, which  is highly expressed in the gubernaculum, results in increased cAMP production  and downstream signaling important in gubernacular development [41].&nbsp; Several genetic studies have examined the  INSL3-RXFP2 pathway to determine the frequency of mutations in either gene in  patients with cryptorchidism.&nbsp; The  available data suggest that variants of one of these genes exist in 3% of  cryptorchid cases [42].&nbsp; However, it is not clear at present which  genetic variants are functionally significant [43-45].&nbsp;&nbsp; As yet unidentified genetic and/or  environmental factors could also alter expression of INSL3 and/or RXFP2 protein  during a critical period of testicular descent.&nbsp;  Indeed, a recent study suggests that levels of INSL3 are reduced in cord  blood of boys with persistent cryptorchidism after birth [46].&nbsp; Further studies are needed to elucidate the  role of this important signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of cryptorchidism  in man.</p>
  <p>Two posterior HOX genes have been identified  as possible candidates for cryptorchidism from murine genetic knockout  phenotypes as loss of either <em>Hoxa10</em> or <em>Hoxa11 </em>is associated with  a nonsyndromic cryptorchid phenotype in transgenic mice [47,48].&nbsp; However, no variants of these genes are  consistently associated with cryptorchidism in human studies [49-51].&nbsp; Similarly, mixed results were obtained in  studies of the association of the estrogen receptor alpha <em>(ESR1)</em> gene in  clinical cryptorchidism [52-55].&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Secondary undescended testes can occur  after inguinal surgery, either due to scar tissue or difficulty in diagnosing  an undescended testis in a young boy with a hernia. Patients with prune belly,  Klinefelter, Noonan, and Prader-Willi syndromes also have undescended testes. </li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>History</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The patient history should include  several points of information: prematurity, exogenous, maternal hormone use  (infertility treatment, oral contraceptives), CNS lesions, previous inguinal  surgery, family history for urologic abnormalities, neonatal deaths, precocious  puberty, infertility, consanguinity. One should also note whether the testis  has ever been palpated previously. </li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Physical Exam</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The undescended testis may be found at  the upper scrotum, in the superficial inguinal pouch (near the pubic tubercle),  in the inguinal canal, or can be nonpalpable. For treatment purposes, the main  distinction that needs to be made is whether or not the testis is palpable. The  patient should be examined sitting in the frogleg position and one should always  &ldquo;look before you touch.&rdquo; With warmed hands, check the size, location, and  texture of the contralateral descended testis. Begin the examination of the  undescended testis at the anterior superior iliac spine. Sweep the groin from  lateral to medial with the nondominant hand. Once the testis is palpated, grasp  it with the dominant hand, and continue to sweep the testis toward the scrotum  with the other hand. With a combination of sweeping and pulling, it is  sometimes possible to bring the testis to the scrotum. Maintain the position of  the testis in the scrotum for a minute, so that the cremaster muscle is  fatigued. Release the testis, and if it remains in place, it is a retractile  testis. If it immediately pops back, it is an undescended testis. For the difficult-to-examine  patient (chubby 6-month-olds or obese youths), having them sit with heels  together and knees abducted or placing them in the &ldquo;catcher&rsquo;s position&rdquo; can  help relax the cremaster. Wetting the fingers of the nondominant hand with  lubricating jelly or soap can also increase the sensitivity of the fingers in  palpating the small, mobile testis.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Testes</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>For the typical patient with a  unilateral (palpable or nonpalpable) undescended testis, or the patient with  bilateral undescended testis and one testis palpable, no further workup is  necessary. The patient with bilateral nonpalpable testes should have a  chromosomal and endocrinologic evaluation, as should the patient with one or  two undescended testes and proximal hypospadias. If the patient has bilateral  nonpalpable testes and is less than three months of age, serum luteinizing  hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, mullerian inhibiting substance, and  testosterone will determine whether testes are present. In infants with  bilateral nonpalpable testes, the postnatal testosterone surge will be absent  if anorchia is present.&nbsp; After three  months age, human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation will result in a  measurable serum testosterone if testes are present. A failure to respond to  human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation in combination with elevated  luteinizing hormone/ follicle-stimulating hormone levels is consistent with  anorchia. </li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Ultrasound (US), CT scan, and MRI can  detect testes in the inguinal region, but this is also the region where they  are most easily palpable. US and CT scan are much less accurate in showing  intra-abdominal testes. Hrebinko and Bellinger found that the most reliable  mode of exam has been the physical exam by a pediatric urologist (84%) compared  to a referring physician (53%) [56]. The  accuracy of imaging studies in this series was 44% and imaging did not  influence management decisions in any of the cases. Similarly, Elder reported  that US has limited usefulness when an experienced surgeon examines a  cryptorchid patient [57].&nbsp; MRI may be useful in identifying an ectopic  abdominal testis, if not found by laparoscopy or open exploration.&nbsp; Yeung et al identified 100% of canalicular  and 96% of intra-abdominal testes using gadolinium enhanced MR angiography [58].&nbsp; However, this technique is expensive,  requires sedation, and results have not been reproducible [59]. Imaging is  rarely necessary preoperatively, since for nonpalpable testes, exam under  anesthesia, open inguinal exploration, or laparoscopy is necessary to confirm  the presence of testes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Differential  Diagnosis</strong></p>
  <p>Retractile testes are commonly confused  with undescended testes. The key to distinguishing them from undescended testes  is the physical exam. All retractile and many undescended testes can be  delivered into the scrotum. The retractile testis will stay in the scrotum  after the cremaster muscle has been overstretched. The low undescended testis  will immediately pop back to its undescended position after being released.&nbsp; Atrophic or &ldquo;vanishing&rdquo; testes are found  anywhere along the normal path to the scrotum. They are believed to be due to  neonatal vascular ischemia. The contralateral descended testis can be  hypertrophied in these boys, but this is not a reliable diagnostic sign. Upon  complete evaluation, 80% of nonpalpable testes are present in either the  abdomen or in the inguinal canal. A child with bilateral nonpalpable testes  should have an endocrine evaluation to rule out anorchia or disorder of sex  development (DSD or intersex). Cryptorchidism associated with hypospadias  should also raise the possibility of DSD states, which occurs in 30% to 40% of  patients, mainly consisting of defects in gonadotropin or testosterone  synthesis.</p>
  <p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Hormone Therapy</strong>&nbsp;  Patients with undescended testes should be referred for surgical  evaluation no later than 6 months of age. Hormonal therapy, including  gonadotropin-releasing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin, has been  widely used in Europe for inducing descent of undescended testes. Treatment is  most successful for low undescended testes. Divergent results have been  reported likely due to suboptimal study design, differences in patient age and  treatment schedules, possible inclusion of retractile testes and variable  follow-up.&nbsp; Several meta-analyses of this  published literature suggest that the effectiveness of primary hormonal therapy  in cryptorchidism is less than 20% [60-62].&nbsp; A recent consensus statement discourages use  of hormone therapy for cryptorchidism [63]. The use of  hormonal therapy after orchiopexy to improve semen analyses in high-risk  patients with very poor germ cell development has been reported to be helpful  in investigations in Europe and the United States.</p>
  <p><strong>SURGERY</strong></p>
  <p>The goals in bringing the testis into  the scrotum include: prevent ongoing thermal damage to the testis, treat the  associated patent hernia sac, prevent testis torsion/injury against the pubic  bone, and achieve a good cosmetic result (avoid the psychological effects of an  empty scrotum) to allow easy future palpation of the testis (testicular  self-exam for cancer). </p>
  <p>Standard inguinal orchidopexy involves  several steps after repeat examination under anesthesia to reconfirm testicular  location.&nbsp;&nbsp; A transverse inguinal  incision is made along Langer&rsquo;s lines and Scarpa&rsquo;s fascia incised with care to  avoid injury to a testis in the superficial inguinal pouch.&nbsp; The testis is mobilized after incision of the  gubernacular remnant.&nbsp; The cremasteric  muscle fibers are transected and the hernia sac isolated, transected, mobilized  to the internal inguinal and ligated.&nbsp;  After division of lateral fascial bands, the testis is placed in the  scrotum in a subcutaneous or subdartos pouch without trans-capsular sutures. </p>
  <p>A primary scrotal approach to orchidopexy is  described in cases where the testis is palpable and is either close to the  scrotum or can be easily drawn into the sac [64-66].&nbsp; Successful mobilization of the testis and  ligation of the hernia sac at the level of the external or internal ring is  described; alternatively a secondary inguinal incision is made if needed.&nbsp; Many series report use of testicular fixation  sutures within the dartos pouch to maintain the testis in a dependent scrotal  position.&nbsp; Testicular retraction or  atrophy has been reported at 0-2%, while postoperative hernia has been noted in  2-3% of cases with follow up in these series ranging from 1 month-3 years.&nbsp; Thus, this approach may be a viable option in  select cases of cryptorchidism when testes are distal to the external ring.</p>
  <p>Further maneuvers may be employed to obtain  adequate length of a high inguinal testis.&nbsp;  Passing the testis behind the inferior epigastric artery and vein after  opening the transversalis fascia (the Prentiss maneuver) will allow more medial  positioning of the cord.&nbsp; Dividing the  internal oblique muscles with lengthening the incision as needed allows further  opening of the internal ring and additional dissection of the lateral spermatic  fascia in the retroperitoneal space.</p>
  <p>A Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy, or division of  the internal spermatic artery, can be performed if extensive dissection between  the vas and cord has not occurred, as testicular survival then relies on the  deferential and external spermatic blood supply.&nbsp; An alternative for the high testis is  microvascular autotransplantation to the ipsilateral inferior epigastric artery  and vein. Rarely, a 2-stage orchiopexy may be used without division of the  spermatic vessels when the Prentiss maneuver and cord dissection fail to  provide adequate length [67]. The testis is anchored in its most dependent  position or the spermatic cord may be wrapped in a protective sheath [41] for ease of the second stage,  generally 6-12 months later.</p>
  <p>Exploration for a nonpalpable testis may  occur through an extended inguinal incision, an abdominal incision, or by  diagnostic laparoscopy.&nbsp; At the time of  exploration, the most likely findings are intra-abdominal or &ldquo;peeping&rdquo; testis  just at the internal ring (25-50%), vanishing testis most commonly distal to  the internal ring (15-40%) or cord structures (vessels and vas) that enter the  internal ring in the presence of a viable testis that is non-palpable due to  the size of the testis or patient&rsquo;s body habitus [68-70].&nbsp; Absence of visible spermatic vessels warrants  further full exploration of the retroperitoneum to document testicular  agenesis, which is extremely rare.&nbsp; The  finding of cord vessels entering the ring warrants inguinal exploration for  identification of a distal viable or vanishing testis.&nbsp; Some surgeons us a primary transscrotal  approach when a palpable scrotal nubbin is present and confirm the diagnosis of  vanishing testis by visualizing a black area containing hemosiderin [71,72].&nbsp; However, if findings are questionable using  this approach, laparoscopy is warranted.&nbsp;  Although controversial, fixation of the solitary testis should be  considered to protect against the theoretical risk of torsion.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Options for treatment of an intra-abdominal  testis are varied depending on the patient&rsquo;s age, testis size, contralateral  testis, and the skills of the surgeon.&nbsp;  Goals are to mobilize all structures extending distal to the internal  ring, transect the peritoneum lateral to the spermatic vessels and distal to  the vas, and to mobilize these vessels proximally while maintaining collateral  blood supply with the vas should a Fowler-Stephens maneuver be required.&nbsp; Adequate length is defined by mobilization of  the testis to the contralateral internal ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;  A new hiatus is created by retrograde passage of a clamp or port at the  level of the medial umbilical ligament.&nbsp;  Formal closure of the dissected internal ring is not necessary [73,74].&nbsp; If dissection does not allow for adequate  length to reach the scrotum, the spermatic vessels are clipped, followed by a  1- or 2-stage operation to bring the testis into the scrotum.&nbsp; The typical success rates of contemporary  series for standard, 1-stage and 2-stage Fowler-Stephens laparoscopic  orchiopexy are 90-100%, 71-97% and 84-96%, respectively [75-78].&nbsp; </p>
  <p>If a testicular nubbin is found within  the scrotum, some surgeons recommend contralateral scrotal testis fixation  since the possibility of a previously unrecognized torsion may have occurred.<br>

<p><strong>Prognosis</strong></p>
  <p>Surgery cannot reverse the maturational  failure of the undescended testis, but it can prevent ongoing thermal injury.  Parents are often concerned about future fertility.&nbsp; Arrested development of spermatogonia is a  common finding in cryptorchid testes and has been recognized for over 40 years  [79].&nbsp; Very low Ad spermatogonia per tubule (Ad/T)  ratios are associated with increased risk for infertility [80,81].&nbsp; However, failure to establish an adequate Ad  spermatogonia population in cryptorchid testes appears to correlate more  closely with sperm counts in adulthood than total Ad/T count alone [82,83].&nbsp; A reduced number of Leydig/interstitial cells  in undescended as compared to contralateral descended testis [84] and with increasing age at  orchidopexy [85] is also reported.&nbsp; In addition, there is disruption of  morphology, failure of maturation at puberty and evidence for reduced number of  Sertoli cells after 4 months of age in the cryptorchid testis [86-89].&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In patients who have undergone  orchiopexy at an early age, abnormal semen quality is common, with reduced  sperm counts reported in 75-100% and 18-43% of formally bilaterally and  unilaterally cryptorchid men, respectively [90-93].&nbsp; However, 90% of boys with unilateral  cryptorchidism and 65% with bilateral cryptorchidism will achieve paternity.  Patients who are interested in their risk for infertility may have a semen  analysis performed at age 18. </p>
  <p>The increased risk of germ cell tumor (GCT)  arising in a cryptorchid testis may be related to persistence of gonocytes,  which as precursors of testicular carcinoma in situ (CIS) may then evolve into  frank GCT [94].&nbsp; Recent analyses by Wood and Elder critically  evaluated several concerns surrounding the topic of cryptorchidism and  testicular cancer [95].&nbsp; They determined from their review that  previous estimates of cancer risk in cryptorchid testes were too high (at 26-40  times greater risk) and are more likely 2.5-8 overall, with a decreased  relative risk of 2-3 if prepubertal orchidopexy is performed.&nbsp; In their review of the risk of malignancy in  contralateral descended testes, they noted that studies suggesting such a risk  demonstrated significant flaws in study design.&nbsp;  In contrast, in a recent meta-analysis Akre et al derived a  significantly increased relative risk of tumor in the contralateral testis of  1.7 (95% C.I. 1.01-2.98) in males with a history of unilateral cryptorchidism [96].</p>
  <p>Recent data suggest that risk of  malignant degeneration may be 2-6 times higher in men who underwent orchidopexy  after puberty as compared to those having surgery at an earlier age [97,98].&nbsp; Orchiectomy is the best option for  post-pubertal males up to age 50 since these gonads have poor fertility  potential and increased risk, while nonoperative treatment is recommended in  men over 50 since their cancer risk has never been defined [95].&nbsp; Finally, the malignant tumor developing in  persistently cryptorchid testes is most commonly seminoma (74%) while after  orchiopexy two-thirds of malignancies are non-seminoma [95].  Approximately 15% of tumors arise in the contralateral descended testis. </p>
  <p>All patients should be taught proper  monthly testicular self-exam at the time of puberty. Some patients with  cryptorchidism are at a higher risk of cancer (prune belly syndrome, ambiguous  genitalia, karyotypic abnormalities, or the postpubertal boy). After successful  orchiopexy, patients are examined at 6 to 12 months to check on testicular size  and position. They are rechecked at puberty to explain the technique and need  for monthly testis self-exam concerning early recognition of testis cancer.  Patients with retractile testes should be examined annually until age 7,  because about 5% will be found to have a testis out of the scrotum.<br>
