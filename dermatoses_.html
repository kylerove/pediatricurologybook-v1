  <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
Pediatric genital dermatoses are unique and  require special consideration. &nbsp;Pediatric  genital skin is different than adult skin.&nbsp;  In children, the absence of sex hormones leaves the genital skin thin  and without the protection of glands, oils, and hair normally seen in adults.&nbsp; Infants and children may also be incontinent,  making the chemical irritation and chronic moisture from feces and urine  exacerbating and causative to a variety of conditions.&nbsp; <br>
Congenital skin conditions often present in  childhood.&nbsp; Additionally, benign  neoplasms suggestive of genetic disease may affect the genitalia.&nbsp; On the contrary, malignant and infectious  dermatologic genitourinary conditions are relatively rare in children when  compared to adults.&nbsp; This is related to  the fact that in general children lack exposure to sexually transmitted  infections and chronic inflammation.<br>
Children have robust immune systems.&nbsp; Atopy is at its peak in childhood and tends  to decline in adulthood.&nbsp; Thus, atopic  dermatitis and other allergy-mediated disorders of the genital skin tend to be  more common and more morbid in children.<br>
Treatment of genital dermatoses in children is  challenging because of concern for systemic side effects of steroids,  immunomodulators, and antifungals.&nbsp;  Expectant management of certain conditions may be appropriate as many  dermatologic lesions are benign and self-limited; however, surgical management  has the advantage of obtaining tissue diagnosis, improving function or cosmesis  of the genitalia, or less commonly, curing the lesion.<br>
Finally, pediatric genitourinary dermatologic  conditions may raise the question of sexual abuse, whether legitimate or  not.&nbsp; Caregivers may be avoidant and may  not endorse a history of genital skin lesions in children.&nbsp; The genital exam in children is often a  sensitive issue already.&nbsp; This is  obviously exacerbated in the setting of abuse.&nbsp; <br>

  <p><strong>Allergic  Dermatitis</strong><br>
    Allergic dermatitis is characterized by pruritic,  erythematous lesions associated with an exposure. The exposure then leads to an  allergy-mediated response. These events are quite common and are often  associated with the genitourinary system.</p>
  <p><strong>Atopic  Dermatitis</strong><br>
    Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a chronic skin  condition characterized by dry, pruritic skin and lichenified eczematous  plaques. Up to 20% of the pediatric population is affected by atopic dermatitis  (AD) and at least 85% of affected individuals show symptoms prior to the age of  5. (Akdis 2006) Genetics play a large role in AD, with more than 20 genes  involved and the propensity for AD to run in families. Atopic dermatitis is  also associated with particular substances and conditions that can worsen  symptoms. These include heat, wool, perspiration, emotional stress,  aeroallergens (dust mites, pollen) and food allergens (Beltrani 1999). Any of  these inciting factors can lead to generalized genital involvement.</p>
  <p><strong>Contact  Dermatitis</strong><br>
    Once thought to be uncommon in the pediatric  population, contact dermatitis is increasingly being recognized in children.  Contact dermatitis is most often divided into two subsets: irritant contact  dermatitis (ICD) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). The presentation of  these two forms is often similar with affected areas limited to areas of  contact. There are however, subtle differences, in that ACD typically presents  with weeping eczematous plaques and ICD is more likely to present with acute  burns. Treatment involves identifying the potential trigger, eliminating its  exposure, and treating the acute inflammatory phase.<br>
    Allergic contact dermatitis involves a Type IV  hypersensitivity reaction, where an individual develops a reaction to a skin  allergen following an initial phase of sensitization. The most common  sensitizers in children are nickel, fragrances, rubber, lanolin and antibiotics  (Katsarou 1996; Sharma 2010). ACD is most often seen as a pruritic eruption,  which can develop into blisters and weeping lesions. Examples of genital  involvement include reactions to cinnamon oil in vaginal suppositories and  vulvar dermatitis to clomitrazole &nbsp;(Lauriola 2010; Pullen 2010). ACD has also  been associated with the nickel found in some bed-wetting alarms (Hanks 1992).  Removal of the offending agents will stop the process of eruption and  irritation.<br>
    Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by the  direct, cytotoxic effects of the offending agent. The severity of reaction can  be altered by duration of contact, environmental factors and concurrent  dermatitis. The most common ICD found in the pediatric population is diaper  dermatitis (DD).&nbsp; Several factors  contribute to the development of DD including friction, urine, feces and  maceration of the skin by water. Inadequate skin care and Candida albicans have  also been shown to increase rates of DD (Berg 1986; Zimmerer 1986). The areas  most susceptible to DD are the perianal, buttocks and intertriginous zones. The  genital area is much more likely to be affected in females (Visscher 2000).  Shorter periods in contact with urine and feces, absorptive diapers and good  hygiene are important in preventing DD. Other therapies include nystatin,  hydrocortisone and protective pastes. All of these come with potential side  effects and may cause primary genitourinary dermatoses on their own (Fiorillo  2004).</p>
  <p><strong>Erythema  Multiforme (Stevens - Johnson Syndrome) </strong><br>
Erythema Multiforme (EM) is a generalized  dermatologic condition, characterized by the acute and self-limited onset of  lesions involving the skin and mucous membranes. EM is classified along a  spectrum including EM minor, EM major, and Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS)  depending on severity.&nbsp; Traditionally, EM  is described as target lesions and symmetric red papules. In its most severe  form, the lesions resemble extensive skin burns with blistering and  erythematous papules (L&eacute;aut&eacute;-Labr&egrave;ze 2000). Lesions of this severity require  intensive care and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. EM  has a predilection to target mucous membranes including, but not limited to,  the genitals and oral mucosa.</p>

  <p>In children, EM is most often associated with  herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, sulfonamides and &szlig;-lactams (Weston  1992; Osterne 2009). EM can be precipitated by both HSV-1 and HSV-2. These  episodes usually follow HSV infection by 10-14 days and are sometimes signaled  by prodromal symptoms. The prodrome is not as severe as that seen with SJS and  can involve fever, headache, and cough. Treatment is supportive and acyclovir  can be prescribed for recurrent episodes (Osterne 2009). Mycoplasma pneumonia  is particularly associated with the development of SJS. It is usually preceded  by a prodromal phase of fever, headache, upper respiratory symptoms and/or  throat pain. When the genitals are involved, the most common presentation  includes erosions, erythema and possible bleeding of the glans and labia  (Vanfletern 2003). Such lesions can lead to complications as seen in a 14-year-old  girl who developed hematocolpos following M. pneumonia-associated SJS with  bullous lesions on both the external and internal genitalia (Murphy 1997).  Treatment is usually limited to supportive measures. If M. pneumonia is found  to be the etiology, the use of antibiotics is warranted. <br>
      <strong>Insect  Bites</strong><br>
    While the trunk and extremities are most often  the sites of insect bites, insect bites to the genitals are not uncommon in  children. The list of insects that have attacked pediatric genitals is long,  but includes mosquitoes, ticks, wasps, mites, ants, chiggers and bees. The  majority of these encounters occur during the warmer months, when children are  outside and exposed insects. While pruritis, erythema and local inflammation  are the most common symptoms, some reactions may be systemic and bites of  particularly venomous can lead to more concerning symptoms. The resultant  hypersensitivity reactions vary in intensity from slight erythema to the  eruption of papules and vesicles. In some cases, the location and particular  form of reaction can be a guide to the offending creature. Erythema migrans  typically indicates a tick bite, while genital eruptions accompanied by bites  on clothing lines suggest chiggers. (Smith 1998) (Elston 2010) If genitals have  been exposed to the open air and bites are associated with erythema, wheals,  and angioedema, mosquitoes may be the culprit. (Kulthanan 2010)</p>
  <p><strong>Figure  4</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Figure  4. Tick bite and associated swelling of the scrotum in a young boy.</strong></p>
  <p>Treatment of these bites is primarily symptomatic  with the use of topical steroids and anti-histamines. Use of long-sleeved  clothing and repellants are useful in preventing insect bites. It is also  important to have patients return if rashes continue or progress or they begin  to notice new onset symptoms (Kulthanan 2010). This may be a sign of bacterial  infection. Fever, malaise, and arthralgias could signal transmission of a  vector-born disease such as Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain spotted fever  (Eleston 2010). Antibiotic treatment then becomes necessary.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Papulosquamous  Disorders</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Lichen Sclerosus (Balanitis xerotixa obliterans)</em></strong></p>
  <p>Lichen  sclerosus is a chronic, inflammatory disease process that primarily affects the  anogenital region of both males and females. The characteristic lesions seen in  this disease process are areas of pallor with thinning, atrophic and fragile  skin. The skin is usually wrinkled and telangiectasias, purpura, fissures and  erosions can be present. Progression of disease can lead to scarring, phimosis  in males and degeneration into squamous cell carcinoma. (Jasaitiene 2008) When  this process is found in males and confined to the penis, it is known as  balanitis xerotica obliterans. It is histologically identical to lichen  sclerosus and is treated no differently. (Kiss 2005) Balanitis xerotica  obliterans can also be associated with lichen planus and cicatricial  pemphigoid. (Mallon 2000) Both lichen sclerosus and the subset of balantic  xerotica obliterans are atrophic and sclerotic process with an unclear  pathophysiology.&nbsp; Work involving an  autoimmune theory, has shown an increased incidence of HLA DQ7 in pediatric  patients. This association is even greater than that seen in adults. (Powell  2000) </p>
  <p><strong>Figure  5</strong><br>
&nbsp;<img src="dermatoses/dermatoses__clip_image001_0001.jpg" alt="figure 5" width="312" height="212"><br>
<strong>Figure  5. Lichen Sclerosus. Note the &ldquo;hour-glass&rdquo; appearance to the vulva and anus,  with atrophic white center and surrounding erythema and hyperpigmentation.</strong></p>
  <p>The disease process seen in children with lichen  sclerosus is slightly different than that in adults. The mean age of first  presentation is 5 years and the mean age of diagnosis 7 years. In girls, the most  common symptoms are itching and soreness. Other symptoms include genital  erosions, fissures, dysuria, purpura and constipation. A small percentage of  girls have no symptoms. In boys, lichen sclerosus is associated with phimosis,  both congenital and acquired. Scarring of the urethral meatus can also lead to  stenosis and even urethral fibrosis (Powell 2001). Diagnosis is most often made  on a clinical basis, but biopsy of lesions will show inflammatory infiltrate  and dermoepidermal degeneration (Kiss 2005). Treatment of lichen sclerosus is  of paramount importance due to the chance of transformation into a malignant  process.&nbsp; The initial treatment for  lichen sclerosus involves potent topical steroids including betamethasone and  clobetasol (Garzon 1998). More recently, immunomodulators such as pimecromilus  and tacrolimus have been used with good results. Surgery may be necessary for  lesions that lead to phimosis, meatal stenosis or urethral stricture. Adjuvant  topical tacrolimus has also been used after surgery and led to subsequent  disease control (Ebert 2008; Steffens 2010). Lichen sclerosus is a relapsing  and remitting disease process.&nbsp;  Nevertheless, in some pediatric cases, lichen sclerosus has completely  resolved. The frequency of resolution is disputed, but it is thought that  pediatric lichen sclerosus has a better prognosis than the adult form. The role  of puberty in this process is also still under debate (Smith 2009).</p>
  <p><strong><em>Psoriasis</em></strong><br>
    Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disorder  that creates classic inflammatory, hyperproliferative lesions. It is a fairly  common disorder, with a prevalence of around 2% in the general population.  Traditionally, these lesions are characterized as plaque-like lesions and are  found on the scalp and extensor surfaces of the body. Psoriasis can present  anywhere and genital involvement is not uncommon.&nbsp; Genital lesions often present as  erythematous, well-demarcated, thin-plaqued lesions that lack the traditional  scaling. If any scaling is involved, it is minimal and can be scraped off with  ease. This will lead to pinpoint bleeding on the exposed surface. In one study,  the mean age for presentation with genital involvement was 35 years of age,  though it can present at any age (Meeuwis 2010).</p>
  <p><strong>Figure  6</strong><br>
    <img width="18" height="81" src="dermatoses/dermatoses__clip_image001_0000.gif"><img width="479" height="360" src="dermatoses/dermatoses__clip_image003.gif"><br>
    <strong>Figure  6. Erythrodermic presentation to psoriasis, with near confluent erythema with  scale.</strong></p>
  <p>When children present to a physician with  erythema, scaling or pruritis in the anogenital region, psoriasis should be  part of the differential diagnosis. Psoriasis is particularly associated with  chronic vulvovaginitis in the pediatric population (Fischer 2010).&nbsp; Diagnosis is usually made after a complete  history and physical is made looking for other skin lesions, progression over  time and family history (Trager 2004). Clinical presentation and history are  usually enough for diagnosis. If diagnosis is not certain, biopsy can be taken  for definitive histological certainty. Another less invasive option is the use  of videodermatoscopy. On examination of psoriatic balanitis with  videodermatoscopy, a consistent pattern of dilated, tortuous capillaries is  seen in all patients (Lacarrubba 2004). If psoriatic involvement is limited to  the genitals, systemic treatment is unnecessary. Along with hygiene and  avoidance of irritating factors, treatment tends to focus on topical steroids,  such as betamethasone, or liquor picis carbonis (LPC) cream (Trager 2004). If  this is not successful, recent trials of immunomodulators like pimecromilus  have had success (Amichai 2004).</p>
  <p><strong><em>Reiter&rsquo;s Syndrome</em></strong><br>
    Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome, also known as reactive  arthritis, is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy characterized by arthritis,  conjunctivitis and urethritis. Traditionally, this disease process is known to  present after bouts of gastrointestinal and urogenital infections in young  males. In general, Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome is more common in adults than children and  males than females. While the exact pathophysiology is not known, it is thought  that the inciting infection may cause cross-reactivity with the organisms or  cytokine release (Wu 2008).<br>
    In children, the most common findings are  bilateral conjunctivitis, dysuria and asymmetric, pauciarticular arthritis. The  severity of symptoms can vary and all need to be present. More generalized  complaints are also seen with fever, malaise and weight loss being reported.  The most common mucocutaneous manifestation of the genitalia is circinate  balanitis or vulvitis. In boys, these lesions are described as ulcers with  shallow, serpiginous borders in uncircumcised boys. In circumcised boys,  hyperkeratotic plaques are described. In studies, these lesions were found in  50% of patients, and the rarity of balanitis and vulvitis should prompt the  consideration of juvenile Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome (Zivony 1997; Manimegalai 2004).  Diagnosis is made based on the clinical constellations and history during  presentation. Abnormal laboratory values can include leukocytosis, elevated ESR  and elevated CRP. While these are nonspecific findings, it has been shown that  the ESR and CRP levels seen in Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome are not as elevated as those  seen in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (Linag 2004). Treatment of Reiter&rsquo;s  syndrome consists of anti-inflammatory medication and, if severe enough,  immunomodulators. Cutaneous manifestations have been successfully treated with  topical steroids and salicylic acid (Zivony 2004).</p>
  <p><strong>Fixed  Drug Eruptions</strong><br>
    Fixed drug eruptions (FDE) are characterized by  sharply demarcated, round lesions that range from 2 to 10 cm in diameter. They  can be erythematous to violaceous and their occurrence is associated with the  ingestion of a particular drug. The timing of development of the lesions can  last from hours to days and the inflamed lesions will resolve within a week.  After the plaques resolve, hyperpigmentation will remain and can last for  months to years. These reactions can manifest anywhere on the body but tend to affect  the trunk, mucous membranes and genitalia. The keys to clinical diagnosis are  the characteristic lesions, recent drug exposure and recurrence in the same location  with repeat exposure (Morelli 1999).<br>
    Fixed drug eruptions are a common dermatologic  skin lesion in children. Genital involvement has been reported in anywhere from  20% to 50% of cases. Clinical presentation usually consists of the  characteristic lesions developing on the vulva, glans and occasionally the  shaft or scrotum of the penis. Children have also reported pruritis, painful  micturition and urinary retention (Nussinovitch 2002). The list of drugs that  can cause these reactions is long, but there are some frequent offenders.  Analgesics such as aspirin and paracetamol have been associated with FDE, along  with colchicine, phenobarbitol, lidocaine and methyphenidate.&nbsp; Antibiotics such as co-trimoxazole, tetracycline,  metronidazole and erythromycin have also been reported as causes.  Co-trimoxazole and tetracycline have been singled out in particular for genital  involvement (Ozkaya-Bayazit 2003; Nussinovitch 2002). While symptoms may be  bothersome and leave behind telltale hyperpigmentation, intervention is not  necessary as this is a benign process. It is prudent; however, to record the  reaction so further exposure does not occur. </p>
  <p><strong>Vesiculobullous  Disorders</strong><br>
This category of dermatologic pathology is  comprised of disorders that involve the targeting of skin and mucous membranes  by autoantibodies. Autoantibodies attack the various structures (desmosomes,  hemidesmosomes) that create structural integrity for the skin and mucous  membranes. The incidence of these disorders is rare, but can lead to extensive  bullae formation. When genital or perianal regions are involved, it is  important to rule out child abuse (Lara-Corrales 2010).</p>
  <p><strong>Bullous  Pemphigoid</strong><br>
    Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a chronic, autoimmune  process characterized by the development of blistering and tense bullae on  normal or inflamed skin. Its incidence in children is rare and the involvement  of genitals even more so.&nbsp; Disease tends  to cluster on the flexural aspects of the skin and oral mucosa. The development  of cutaneous manifestations involves IgG autoantibodies targeting the skin  basement membrane zone (BMZ) and subsequent blistering. Confirmation of  diagnosis requires biopsy with direct immunofluorescence and the isolation of  target antigens can be helpful in some cases&nbsp;  (Fisler 2003).</p>

      <strong>Figure  7. Bullous pemphigoid in a child, with multiple tense bullae on a surrounding  bed of</strong> erythema.</p>
  <p>While genital involvement in children is rare,  multiple cases have been reported in both boys and girls. When involving boys,  disease characteristics include chronic inflammation and blistering of the  glans and severe phimosis is a possibility (Mirza 2008). In young women, BP is  characterized by discomfort, dysuria and subepidermal blistering of the  vulva.&nbsp; Again, immunofluorescence has demonstrated  linear deposition of IgG at the dermoepidermal junction and antigens to BP230  and BP180.&nbsp; The majority of these  patients do well with no resulting scarring or disfigurement of the vulva  (Farrell 1998). Patients who have more widespread, systemic involvement tend to  have less satisfactory outcomes and may require more aggressive therapies.<br>
Treatment of BP tends to be very successful, with  multiple options available to the physician. Oral corticosteroids tend to be  the first-line therapy with doses ranging from 1-2 mg/kg/day. The addition of  dapsone and sulfapyridine has also shown benefit in some cases (Mirza 2008).  Topical preparations such as clobetasol propionate cream, oxytetracycline and  nystatin have also shown efficacy (Farrell 1998).&nbsp; When these measures are unsuccessful, one can  try more potent corticosteroids and pulse therapy. If these measures are still  not successful, the use of IVIG in conjunction with steroids has been shown to  yield therapeutic result (Sugawara 2007).<br>

  <p><strong>Pemphigus  Vulgaris</strong><br>
    Pemphigus represents a group of rare dermal  diseases characterized by the autoimmune blistering of the skin and mucous  membranes. In pemphigus patients, autoantibodies directed against desmosomal  proteins leads to intraepidermal cleavage and blistering in the deep  dermis.&nbsp; Immunofluorescence of biopsy  specimens suggests a predominantly IgG mediated process accompanied by C3  deposits (Martel 2001). The development of pemphigus in children is rare, with  the majority of cases presenting between the fourth and sixth decades of life.&nbsp; <br>
    As in adult disease, childhood pemphigus results  in recurrent blistering of the skin and mucosal surfaces and suprabasal  separation of the skin. With disease progression, blistered surfaces eventually  rupture, leaving denuded and raw skin. Nikolsky&rsquo;s sign is oftentimes  positive.&nbsp; Genital involvement is rare,  but consists of blistering of vaginal mucosa (Wananukul 1999). Like most  autoimmune processes, steroid therapy plays a central role in the care of these  patients. Oral corticosteroids form the base of therapy with the addition of  dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil, azothioprine and cyclophosphamide in refractory  cases (Yazganoglu 2006).&nbsp; More recently,  the use of rituximab, a mono-clonal antiCD20 antibody, has been suggested for  use in cases refractory to traditional approaches. Rituximab is usually  administered with IVIG, though more research is needed to elucidate the most  efficacious clinical approach (Fuertes 2010).</p>
  <p><strong>Epidermolysis  Bullosa</strong><br>
    Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare, congenital  dermatologic condition characterized by fragile skin and frequent blistering  and breakdown of mucous membranes and the dermis. This condition is broken into  three major categories: EB simplex, junctional EB, and dystrophic EB. The distinction  between particular forms is determined by particular gene involvement and the  particular component of the cutaneous basement membrane zone. Initial diagnosis  is usually made from clinical manifestations and family history of blistering  disorders. Confirmatory diagnosis can be made via biopsy and subsequent direct  immunofluorescence microscopy or electron microscope (Sawamura 2010).  Involvement of the genitourinary tract is a significant component to the  disease process. In fact, any patient with junctional or dystrophic  epidermolysis bullosa, hematuria or pyloric stenosis should be evaluated for  genitourinary involvement.</p>
  <p><strong>Figure  8</strong><br>

    <strong>Figure  8. Development of meatal stenosis in a boy with epidermolysis bullosa.</strong><br>
Genitourinary complications of epidermolysis  bullosa are most frequently seen with the junctional and dystrophic forms.  Dermatologic findings of the genitals can include meatal stenosis, ulceration  of the glans and labia, scarring of the glans, fusion of the labia, and  narrowing of the vaginal vestibule. Along with the more outward signs, the  entire genitourinary tract can be affected by strictures and related  complications (Fine 2004; Srinivasin 2007). Along with the pain and discomfort  associated with blistering, children may also present with dysuria, straining,  and recurrent infections.&nbsp; With few  options for treating the disease process itself, the main goal of the urologist  should be preservation of renal function. Due to the tendency for stricture development  and bladder dysfunction, the primary mode of treatment is urinary diversion.  The particular form of diversion, cutaneous or gastrointestinal, chosen is  dependent on the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and patient  prognosis (Donatucci 1992).</p>

  <p><strong>Noninfectious  Ulcers</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Pyoderma Gangrenosum</em></strong><br>
Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an immune-mediated  process characterized by the development of ulcerative skin disease. These  ulcers, which can range in size, depth and location, are usually preceded by  pustules. Pyoderma gangrenosum has traditionally been associated with other  systemic conditions. These include, but are not limited to, inflammatory bowel  disease (IBD) and myeloproliferative disorders such as monoclonal gammopathy  and myeloma.&nbsp; Histologically, this  disease process is associated with an inflammatory infiltrate involving  neutrophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes.&nbsp;  These cells have been shown to produce a number of inflammatory  cytokines, TNF-&alpha; in particular, which contribute to the pathology (Marzano  2010). Diagnosis is notoriously difficult though particular clinical  manifestations may suggest PG. These include ulcer involvement on one or both  legs, systemic disease, pathergy, pustules and ulcers with undermined edges (Hadi  2010).<br>
Cases of PG in children only account for 4% of  all cases, with involvement of the genitals being only a portion of this  subset.&nbsp; While exceedingly rare, both  vulvar and penile involvement has been reported. In one case, diagnosis of PG  was made in a young girl with ulcerative, purulent lesions with undermined  edges found on the labia majora. This case was associated with an elevated  inflammatory response and neutrophilic infiltrate on biopsy (Garcovich 2009).  Involvement of the penis has also been demonstrated with ulceration of the  glans, frenulum and shaft.&nbsp; Progression  of PG in these instances can also lead to complications such as urethral  fistulas (Georgala 2008). Treatment of PG in these cases focused on immune  modulation.&nbsp; First-line therapy is  considered to be corticosteroids and cyclosporine.&nbsp; For more refractory cases, TNF-&alpha; antagonists  such as infliximab and other immunosuppresives such as tacrolimus have been  suggested (Marzano 2010).</p>
  <p><strong><em>Beh&ccedil;et's disease</em></strong><br>
    Beh&ccedil;et's disease is a multisystem inflammatory  disease of unknown cause. It has a storied history and traces it roots along  the Old Silk Road that connected East to West. This rare disease is  characterized by recurrent oral ulcerations accompanied by genital ulceration,  eye lesions (anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, and retinal vasculitis), skin  lesions (erythema nodosum, acneiform nodules, and pseudofolliculitis) and skin  pathergy. The incidence of Beh&ccedil;et's disease is thought to vary among  populations with presentations varying as well. A study of a North American  population reported an incidence of 0.38 per 100,000 persons (Calamia 2009).<br>
    Beh&ccedil;et's tends to develop in the third and fourth  decades of life, though the disease is not absent in children. While some cases  are reported as early as the first year of life, the median age for  presentation is about 15 years. Genital lesions have been reported in up to 70%  of pediatric patients with proclivity for the vulva, scrotum and penis. There  are some reports of perianal involvement as well (Kon&eacute;-Paut 2005; Carvalho  2007). Diagnosis of BD is based on clinical criteria and international  standards, though a positive skin pathergy test can be confirmatory.&nbsp; Multiple pharmacologic therapies have been  tried with Beh&ccedil;et's disease, though there have been few studies specifically  looking at treatment of the genital manifestations in children. Topical  preparations such as triamcinilone can be used for mild cases. If mucocutaneous  disease is severe, systemic therapies such as colchicine, cyclophosphamide and  azothioprine can be tried (Ozen 2010). In one particular case, thalidomide was  successful in controlling genital ulceration (Carvalho 2007).</p>
  <p><strong>Infections  and Infestations</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Fournier&rsquo;s Gangrene</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Figure  10</strong><br>
    <img src="dermatoses/dermatoses__clip_image002_0003.jpg" alt="figure 10" width="360" height="269"><br>
    <strong>Figure  10. </strong><strong>Fournier&rsquo;s  gangrene of the scrotum in a young boy. </strong></p>
  <p>Fournier&rsquo;s Gangrene (FG) is the acute development  of necrotizing fasciitis of the scrotum, perineum or perianal area and is  associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; Common risk-factors include diabetes  mellitus, old age, malignancy, and immunocompromised states. The initial source  of infection tends to come from colorectal disease, urologic disease and trauma.&nbsp; As this is an infectious process, culture of  necrotic tissue grows multiple organisms in the majority of cases (Yanar 2006).  Speciation of these polymicrobial infections most often indicates colonization  by <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>. The most common  symptoms associated with the presentation of FG are fever, pain and swelling of  the genital and perianal region, purulent discharge and erythematous changes to  the skin (Chen 2010). One can also see skin crepitation and pain out of  proportion to the history. FG is a surgical emergency due to the tendency of  quick progression of infection to the abdominal wall and cavity.&nbsp; This can quickly lead to sepsis and  mortality. For this reason, FG must be ruled out in any instance of soft tissue  infection involving the genitals or perianal regions.<br>
Fournier&rsquo;s gangrene is a rare entity in the  pediatric population, though cases have even been documented in neonates.&nbsp; In children, the presentation and management  of FG is quite similar to that of adults, though the onset of infection has  also been associated with circumcision, insect bites and improper hygiene  (Ekingen 2008). FG has also been associated with varicella infection in a few  reported cases (Jefferies 2010). Regardless of etiology, FG continues to be a  surgical emergency and requires swift action.<br>
Management of FG is based on a timely diagnosis,  initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement.&nbsp; Proper wound care is also paramount in these  patients with frequent dressing changes and attention to keeping the affected  area clean. This may necessitate the need for urinary or fecal diversion  (Ekingen 2008). After the patient has stabilized, attention can be turned  towards reconstructive measures using skin grafts and various flaps.  Improvements in quality of life are associated with early wound coverage and  reconstructive surgery (Chen 2010). Despite aggressive treatment, mortality in  patients with FG can be as high as 30-40%. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Molluscum Contagiosum</em></strong><br>
    Molluscum contagiosum is a dermatologic process  caused by a set of viruses from the Poxviridae family. These viruses, MCVs-1, 2  and 3, cause raised, umbilicated lesions of the epidermis.&nbsp; Lesions can be multiple and are typically  flesh colored, umbilicated papules. Lesions caused by MCV are for the most part  self-limited, but can last anywhere from 6 months to 5 years.&nbsp; Because the majority of infection is spread  via sexual contact, it is considered a sexually-transmitted disease (Tyring  2003). In the pediatric population, two-thirds of cases are found in children  under the age of eight and more than half of MC at multiple sites (Dohil 2005).  When MC is suspected, diagnosis is usually one of a clinical nature, though  biopsy can be performed in atypical cases. Physicians must also keep in mind  that the development of MC in a pediatric patient may be a sign of possible  sexual misconduct on the part of caregiver or other close contacts.</p>
  <p><strong>Figure  11</strong><br>
    <img src="dermatoses/dermatoses__clip_image001_0002.jpg" alt="figure 11" width="312" height="212"><br>
    <strong>Figure  11. Mollucsum contagiosum, notice multiple umbilicated papules on the  periorificial area of this young child.</strong></p>
  <p>With the presentation of flesh-colored papules in  the genital, suprapubic or perianal regions in a child, MC must be part of the  differential. Once diagnosed, there are several treatment options. Because  these lesions will resolve on their own, watchful waiting is an option. This  may not be an appropriate option for some individuals due to personal  preference and the risk of spread to close contacts. Topical treatments  including tretinoin, imiquimod and cidofovir have all been used with clinical  success in the pediatric population.&nbsp;  More aggressive and clinician-performed treatments include curettage,  cryotherapy and cantharone (not available in the US) (Trager 2005). With a wide  range of options and positive outcome of infections, this is can be considered  a fairly benign process.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong><em>Condyloma Accuminata (Genital Warts)</em></strong><br>
    Condyloma accuminata are lesions caused by human  papilloma viruses (HPV). It is an extremely common infection in adults and is  becoming increasingly more common in the pediatric population. Modes of  transmission can include vertical, innocent and sexual contact.&nbsp; The incubation period for the virus can range  from 1 to 20 months (Allen 1998). In children, the most common presentation is  that of anogenital warts, but can progress to large, cutaneous, fungating  lesions. Vulvar lesions are particularly common. In select cases, lesions may  became invasive and destroy underlying structures (Gor 2009). Diagnosis can be  made on a clinical basis, but if more certainty is needed, diagnosis can be confirmed  with immunohistochemical staining and HPV typification.</p>
  <p><strong>Figure  12</strong><br>
      <img src="dermatoses/dermatoses__clip_image002_0004.jpg" alt="figure 12" width="312" height="234"><br>
      <strong>Figure  12. </strong><strong>Genital  warts associated with the dorsal aspect of the penis.</strong></p>
  <p>Spontaneous remission is possible in pediatric  patients, though this not thought to be the norm. Unfortunately, the multiple  drug therapies available have poor cure rates and condyloma has a high rate of  relapse. In one study, children who did not experience spontaneous remission  within two years were unlikely to see subsequent remission or response to treatment  (Allen 1998).&nbsp; Available treatment  options include cimetidine, podophyllin, cryotherapy, electrocautery, and  cantharadin (Krogh 1994). Approaches that focus on epithelial destruction are  associated with pain and discomfort.&nbsp;  Creams such as podofilox and imiquimod are associated with good  response, and less irritation, but long-term efficacy is still unknown (Moresi  2008). Another therapeutic option is photodynamic therapy using 20%  5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) gel and a He-Ne laser. Results in one case involving  vulvar lesions in a 9-year-old girl were promising with complete resolution of  lesions. While this treatment is expensive and limited to external warts, it is  also notable for its lack of scarring and pain (Chen 2010).</p>
  <p><strong>Miscellaneous  Cutaneous Disorders</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Pearly Penile Papules</em></strong><br>
    Pearly penile papules are benign lesions  generally found near the corona of the penis and occasionally on the shaft.  Characteristics of the lesions can be variable, though they tend to be 1-2 mm  in width and 1-4 mm in length. The color of the lesions can be pink, yellow,  white or translucent. The majority of these benign lesions are found  incidentally or after being brought to the attention of the physician by a  concerned patient. Pearly penile papules are asymptomatic in the majority of  cases and are seen following puberty. Histologically, these lesions are related  to acral angiofibromas (Agrawal 2004).</p>
  <p><strong>Figure  13</strong><br>
      <img src="dermatoses/dermatoses__clip_image001_0003.jpg" alt="figure 13" width="324" height="220"><br>
      <strong>Figure  13. Pearly penile papules.</strong></p>
  <p>With the majority of cases being diagnosed  several years after puberty, the incidence of pearly penile papules is thought  to be extremely low. Nevertheless, there have been pediatric cases reported.  Presentation is asymptomatic and similar to that of adults (Neri 1997). In  pediatric cases, molluscum contagiosum and condyloma accuminata must be  considered. Diagnosis can be made with biopsy and histologic characterization.  Another option is the use of dermoscopy, which has the advantage of being  non-invasive (Ozeki 2008). When treatment is desired, cryotherapy and carbon  dioxide laser are the preferred methods (Agrawal 2004).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><em>Capillary Hemangiomata</em></strong><br>
    Capillary hemangiomata, both cutaneous and  cavernous forms, are a very common congenital lesion found in the pediatric  population. While they can be found in a number of locations, they are rarely  associated with the genitalia or perianal area. The majority of cutaneous  lesions are associated with the glans (Tsuji 1998). When these lesions are  found, they tend to present in the first two years of life with swelling and  occasional discomfort. In one case report, the swelling associated with a  hemangioma of the glans led to paraphimosis (Yigiter 2007).<br>
    Hemangioma diagnosis includes biopsy, with the  requisite staining and antigen isolation, and Doppler ultrasound studies. En  bloc excision is the primary form of management for large lesions. When  resecting cavernous hemangiomas, it is important for the surgeon to be aware  that they may infiltrate deeper than expected (Ferrer 1994). When lesions are  small, superficial or located in particularly delicate areas, laser therapy is  an option (Yigiter 2007). Sclerotherapy is also an option for cutaneous lesions  (Tsuji 1998).</p>
  <p><strong><em>Granuloma Anulare</em></strong><br>
    Granuloma anulare is a benign condition  characterized by granulomatous lesions. This is an inflammatory process where  reactive inflammation and fibrosis surround areas of collagen degeneration.  These lesions can come in four forms: annular, generalized, perforating and  subcutaneous. The subcutaneous form is most often seen in the pediatric  population (Forman 2008). While it is common for granuloma anulare to affect  areas over bony prominences, it is rare for it to involve the genitals.  Granuloma anulare of the genitals is asymptomatic except for the psychologic  distress it may impart. Diagnosis is made via biopsy. Treatment can include  complete excision, intralesion steroids, or conservative watch-and-wait  management (Sidwell 2005).</p>
  <p><strong><em>Neurofibroma</em></strong><br>
    Neurofibromas are benign tumors arising from the  Schwann cells that comprise the nerve sheaths of peripheral and visceral nerves.  These masses are associated with von Recklinghausen&rsquo;s disease, also known as  neurofibramatosis. The form in which these tumors present can vary greatly from  small, superficial masses to large tumors that deeply infiltrate. These large,  tortuous masses are known as plexiform neurofibromas, and carry the risk of  malignant transformation. Development of these masses can be found all over the  body, but genital involvement is rare (Littlejohn 2000; Mazdak 2007).<br>
    Genital involvement of neurofibromas can be found  in both sexes. These soft tissue masses can involve the penis, scrotum, labia  and clitoris. Mass effect of the tumors can lead to semi-hypertrophy of the  penis, obstruction of the urethra and clitoromegaly. A fraction of  neurofibromas extend into the pelvis and can abut the bladder and rectum  (Pascual-Castroviejo 2008) .Workup of these masses requires enhanced MRI to  determine the degree of involvement and planning for surgical approach. If  complete resection is possible, this is the best mode of therapy. If nearby  structures prevent full excision, removal of part of the tumor mass is  warranted. Partial resection requires frequent follow-up with MRI due to the  risk of future malignancy (Mazdak 2007).</p>
