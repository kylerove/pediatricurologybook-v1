  <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrenal tumors occur rarely in  childhood, but neuroblastoma accounts for more than 90% of these tumors.&nbsp; In the United States, the incidence of  neuroblastoma was recently reported as 1:1/100,000 person-years.1&nbsp; The adrenal cortex accounts for 6% of adrenal  cancers in children, and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) constitutes 0.2% of  malignant neoplasms in white children less than 15 years of age.2,3&nbsp; Furthermore, adrenal chromaffin cells  contribute to pediatric neoplastic processes in the form of pheochromocytoma  (PCC).&nbsp; In this chapter, discussion is  limited to the adrenal cortical tumor (ACT) and PCC.</p>
  <p><strong>Epidemiology</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most commonly encountered  pediatric adrenocortical tumors (ACT) are adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and  adrenocortical adenoma (ACA).&nbsp; Because of  the relative infrequency of occurrence and difficulty in distinguishing ACC  from ACA, the two are often reported under the broader term of ACT in the  literature.&nbsp; Lack et al reported  thoroughly on ACT in 1992 and estimated a total of 19 new cases of ACC and 6  new cases of ACA each year for persons less than 20 years of age in the United  States.3&nbsp; The annual incidence  is estimated, from the same data, to be 3 per million persons under age 20  years.3&nbsp; Worldwide incidence  is reported to be between 0.3 and 0.38 per million children below 15 years of  age.4&nbsp; In southern Brazil, the  incidence is reported to be as high as 4.2 per million children less than 15  years of age,5 with another report suggesting an incidence equal to  that of Wilms&rsquo; tumor, neuroblastoma and non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma.6<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A review of several case series  suggests a mean age of presentation to be 6 years3,4,6-14 with a  female to male ratio of 1.6 to 1.35,6,8-14&nbsp; There have also been a reports of antenatally  diagnosed ACA and ACC.15,16</p>
  <p><strong>Embryology and Genetics</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adult adrenal gland is composed  of three zones and the inner medulla.&nbsp;  The adrenal cortex arisies from intermediate mesoderm and the medulla  arises from neuroectoderm.&nbsp; The cortex  from outer to inner is divided into three biologically distinct zones: zona  glomerulosa, zona fasciculata and zona reticularis.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fetal adrenal gland, one  finds a large inner zone (fetal zone) and a small outer zone (definitive  zone).&nbsp; The fetal zone will disappear by  6 months of age, while the definitive zone will undergo maturation into the  zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata by 3 years of age.&nbsp; The reticularis begins development after 4  years of age and may not fully mature until age 15.&nbsp; The mechanism responsible for zonal  differentiation within the adrenal gland is not fully understood.&nbsp; It is generally believed that there are  intra/subcapsular and/or zone specific stem cells responsible for  differentiation.17-19<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the developing fetus, the formation  of the adrenogonadal primordia (AGP) marks the first of several distinct events  that result in the formation of the fetal adrenal gland.17&nbsp; The cells of the adrenal cortex are present  in the AGP along the urogenital ridge and can be identified as early as week 4  of development by staining for steroidogenic factor 1 (Sf1).17 The  bilateral AGP divide to form the adrenal and gonadal primordia, a process  dependent upon expression of Sf1. Sf1 expression is encouraged, in part, by  WT-1 and Pbx1.&nbsp; Further definition of the  adrenal primordia occurs with mesenchymal encapsulation, after which time the  definitive zone becomes evident between the capsule and fetal zone. It is  proposed that the capsular formation creates an environment that both recruits  and directs stem cell development toward unique zonal steroidogenic  potential.&nbsp; Kim et al presented a  comprehensive review of their data and the available literature regarding  adrenocortical stem cell biology.17&nbsp;  These authors also commented on the possibility of cancer stem cells and  dysregulation possibly associated with mutations of IGF-II, p53 and APC genes  in Beckwith-Wiedemann, Li-Fraumeni and familial adenomatous polyposis  respectively.&nbsp; These specific examples  could serve as models for development of adrenocortical neoplasms.&nbsp; By 28 weeks gestational age, the adrenal  gland, from outer to inner, is composed of the capsule, definitive zone,  (possibly) small &ldquo;transition&rdquo; zone, the large fetal zone and the medulla.18  &nbsp;It is at around the 9th  week of gestation that neuroectodermal cells migrate to become the center of  the adrenal primordia at the same time that encapsulation is occurring.&nbsp; At birth, the adrenal glands are about twice  as large as an adult adrenal.&nbsp; With  involution of the fetal zone by 6 months of age, they decrease in size, while  the definitive zone actually enlarges to become the glomerulosa and  fasciculata.18&nbsp; Human adrenal  development remains marginally understood.&nbsp;  Kempna and Fluck described the differentiation of the adrenal primordia  as &ldquo;encoded by a specific sequence of genes which are expressed in a  spatio-temporal exact fashion, and by paracrine factors.&rdquo;18&nbsp; Unique, steroidogenic zonation may be  regulated by a paracrine effect of the manufactured hormones and their  expression regulators.&nbsp; Kim et al allude  to this &ldquo;capsular niche&rdquo; as a self-regulating and developing environment  wherein aberrations at the molecular level may lead to disorders of function  and/or neoplastic processes.17&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Etiology and Pathophysiology</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since initial reports of adrenocortical  tumors in siblings and their association with Beckwith-Weidemann and  Li-Fraumeni syndromes, it has been suspected that there is a genetic  explanation for ACT.&nbsp; As is the case with  many neoplastic processes, oncogenes and tumor suppressor gene mutations have  been investigated as potential culprits.&nbsp;  Although specific etiology is unknown, there are several genomic areas  that deserve consideration (Table 1).20,21 </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the work in the field is not  specific to pediatric ACT as most are observed in adults with the incidence of  incidentally discovered adrenal masses increasing from 0.06 (0-9 years) to 6.9%  (70 and over) over eight decades of life.21&nbsp; Additionally, when considering adult age  groups, the prevalence is 4 to 12 per million.22&nbsp; That said, after years of inexplicably  increased incidence of pediatric ACC (10-15 times higher) in southern Brazil,  investigators reported an R377H (Arg337His) mutation in exon 10 of the p53 gene  in nearly all children with ACC (77-97%).23,24&nbsp; It may be hypothesized that the occurrence of  childhood ACT implies a TP53 germline mutation, but animal, knockout models  suggest other factors.&nbsp; When considering  ACT occurrence in other syndromes, it is evident that there are many factors  contributing.&nbsp; Matzuk et al reported an  investigation in which inhibin-alpha knockout mice were observed to develop ACT  by 5 weeks of age.25&nbsp; Loss of  heterozygosity at 2q33 is a mutation of inhibin-alpha that has been observed in  human pediatric ACT&rsquo;s(8 of 9 patients analyzed), suggesting its function as a  suppressor gene.26&nbsp; West et al  presented the first series of childhood ACT gene expression profiles in 2007.27&nbsp; Some significant aspects of that series  included underexpression of major histocompatibility class II genes in ACC  compared to ACA, overexpression of FGFR4 and IGF-II in ACT compared to normal  cortex and conspicuous underexpression of KCNQ1, CDKN1C and HSD3B2 in ACT  samples.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishing clonality in a  population of tumor cells has and can provide insight as to the cellular origin  of ACT.&nbsp; It has been demonstrated that  ACC are made up of monoclonal populations, suggesting an intrinsic genetic mutation  as we have seen in cases of ACC with TP53 germline mutations; ACA can be  monoclonal or polyclonal (local or systemic stimuli).28<br>
Complete  illumination of the etiology in childhood ACT may be possible in the future  with comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), microsatellite markers and genetic  engineering&mdash;for example, CGH has shown that 28% of ACA carry chromosomal  alteration and microsatellite markers have shown loss of heterozygosity (LOH)  at 11q13, 17p13 and 2p16 in ACC.29-33&nbsp; CGH and microsatellite markers have suggested  the presence of currently unmapped tumor suppressor genes and/or  oncogenes.&nbsp; With development of cell line  cultures and knockout animal models, it may be possible to direct therapy  toward specific areas within the genome that are discovered to  suppress/encourage tumorigenesis.&nbsp; It is  within this that a hope for earlier diagnosis and targeted therapies for  aggressive ACC exists with continued development of registries, tissue  repositories and collaborative studies.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation and Diagnosis</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most antenatally detected suprarenal  tumors are attributed to neurobalstoma.&nbsp;  It is important to note that fetal adrenal hemorrhage will lack arterial  flow, distinguishing the entity form solid tumors.34&nbsp; Sauvat et al reported a multicenter  investigation in which 30 prenatal suprarenal lesions were either attributed to  neuroblastoma, regressed or were benign35; however, there have been  reports of maternal sonography detecting ACT&rsquo;s.15&nbsp; In 2008, Sherer et al described the first  reported case of antenatally detected ACA.15&nbsp; The authors described the sonographic  appearance of the 3 x 3 x 3 cm suprarenal mass as heterogeneous containing  cystic and solid elements, similar to well described appearance of  neuroblastoma in fetal sonographic imaging.&nbsp;  The differential diagnosis should include neuroblastoma , adrenal  hemorrhage, adrenal cysts, ACT, macrocyst associated with Beckwith-Weidemann,  sub-diaphragmatic extra-pulmonary sequestration, renal lesions/anomalies,  congenital cystic adenomatoid&nbsp;  malformation and mesenteric/enteric duplication cysts.15,35,36&nbsp; Hishiki et al shared a case report in which a  solid suprarenal lesion demonstrated antenatally was proven to be ACC.16&nbsp; Despite its infrequency, ACT should be  included in the differential diagnosis for antenatally detected suprarenal  masses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACT most commonly presents with  signs of virilization (hirsutism, penile or clitoral enlargement) and/or  hypercortisolism (Cushingoid features).&nbsp;  One hundred twenty of 134 patients (89.5%) from 5 different case series  presented with signs of virilization, with or without Cushingoid features.6,8,14,27,37&nbsp; Ten percent of children presented without  signs of endocrine dysfunction in a large series of children with ACT reported  by Michalkiewicz et al; the children (presumptively) presented with  constitutional symptoms and/or an abdominal mass.38&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the child with presenting signs  or symptoms, it is paramount to establish a diagnosis early.&nbsp; ACC is, indeed, rare, but in its advanced  stages it is insurmountable.&nbsp; Early diagnosis  increases the possibility of curative treatment.&nbsp; As most ACT in children are hormonally  active, ACT should be considered in the evaluation of a child presenting with  abnormal hair growth, penile or clitoral enlargement, acne, hypertension, and,  rarely, unexplained constitutional symptoms.&nbsp;  Obtainable objective data includes laboratory and radiologic  investigations.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Laboratory</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; With older reports stating  as many as 95% of ACT as hormonally active39, it is useful to recall  the distinct steroidogenic zones of the cortex.&nbsp;  Most commonly, the clinician will encounter signs of virilization with  or without Cushingoid features.&nbsp;  Measurement of androgens and metabolites is necessary to establish or  rule out ACT.&nbsp; Measurement of serum  testosterone, serum dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and the adrenal-specific  DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S) and urinary 17-ketosteroids will often return elevated  values.&nbsp; Hypercortisolism may be  suspected in presence of classic features such as central obesity, &ldquo;moon  facies,&rdquo; muscle atrophy, striae and hirsutism; however, younger children may  present with generalized obesity.7&nbsp;  A variety of laboratory tests are available in diagnosing  hypercortisolism, including daily urinary cortisol levels, basal ACTH, basal  cortisol, 17-hydroxycorticosteroid and dexamethasone suppression tests.&nbsp; Adrenal-dependent hypercortisolism can also  be diagnosed by recording an elevated midnight cortisol with failed high dose  dexamethasone suppression.40&nbsp;  In rare cases of feminization and mineralocorticoid producing ACT,  estradiol and a plasma aldosterone/renin ratio can be utilized.&nbsp; Laboratory values can also be used in  follow-up as complete excision of ACT should result in normalization of these  values within 7 days.&nbsp; If evaluating a  small, androgen secreting adrenal mass, dexamethasone suppression of DHEA-S,  androstenedione and testosterone suggests against the diagnosis of ACT.41&nbsp; Table 2 lists useful measurements in  different clinical settings.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>Radiology</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Available modalities for adrenal imaging  include radiography, ultrasonography (US), intravenous pyelography (IVP),  computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission  tomography (PET) and meta-iodobenzylguanadine (MIBG) scintiscan.41&nbsp; According to Ozturk et al, with support from  other authors, CT is most useful in evaluating the adrenal gland.41&nbsp; These authors recommend a detailed CT  protocol for evaluating adrenal lesions consisting of 2.5-3 mm collimation,  oral and intravenous contrast and 1.5-3 mm&nbsp;  reconstruction through the adrenal region. CT evaluation of adrenal  adenomas can be expected to demonstrate a round or nodular lesion less than 4 cm  in diameter with a homogenous, low-density&nbsp;  (&lt;10 Hounsfield units) appearance.&nbsp;  In adult adenoma, as many as 30% will not contain sufficient lipids to  appear as low-density lesions.42,43&nbsp;  Considering significant cross-over between pediatric ACC and ACA histopathologically,  it seems unlikely that CT could reliably distinguish between the two.&nbsp; Additionally, the difficulty in  distinguishing the two virtually assures that all ACT detected in children will  be excised after appropriate workup to ascertain a diagnosis (i.e. ACT, PCC,  NB).&nbsp; However, more recent reports  regarding nonfunctional adrenal masses in adults (&ldquo;incidentalomas&rdquo;) virtually  assure the presence of adenoma if the enhanced tumor is &lt;10 Hounsfield units.44<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MRI and PET are potentially useful  and have been utilized in the workup, again, of the &ldquo;incidentaloma,&rdquo; attempting  to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions in adults.&nbsp; MRI may be very useful for determining extent  of ACT extension and local invasion, but really has no practical application  for differentiating between ACC and ACA in the pediatric patient.&nbsp; PET or PET/CT could be potentially useful in  postoperative evaluation for recurrence, but there is, at current, scarce  literature about its use in this specific clinical scenario.&nbsp; NP-59 has a high positive predictive value  for ACA, but is not currently approved by the United States Food and Drug  Administration for that use.44&nbsp;  Most case series report the use of US and CT for diagnosis; however,  perhaps with more pediatric specific prospective trials, immunohistochemical  and clinical correlation, imaging will prove more useful in differentiating ACC  from ACA.&nbsp; It seems appropriate and  necessary to currently employ US, CT and possibly MRI for preoperative  evaluation of the child for staging and planned anatomic approach in  excision.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be preferable in the  case of questionable local invasion to use a finer collimating modality such as  MRI.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As previously noted, complete  surgical excision is the only curative method of treatment in pediatric  ACT.&nbsp; Preoperative staging is dependent  upon whether local invasion or distant disease is radiologically  demonstrable.&nbsp; Biopsy should be avoided,  if only to avoid tumor rupture.41&nbsp;  In the appropriate surgical candidate, the approach largely depends on  tumor size, presence of local invasion, surgeon experience and technological  availability.&nbsp; It seems logical that if  complete surgical resection is the best chance for cure, one should use an  approach that would allow wide dissection, delicate tumor manipulation and the  possibility of en bloc resection of adjacent structures if necessary.&nbsp; In that regard, Ribeiro and Figueiredo  advocate an ipsilateral, subcostal approach that may easily be extended to a  chevron incision if necessary.41&nbsp;  They also emphasize the friable and necrotic nature encountered in ACT  and actually recommend against a laparoscopic approach to excision of the  pediatric ACT. Although laparoscopic surgery has proven safe and effective for  benign, adult adrenal tumors, other investigators have also proposed open  adrenalectomy over a laparoscopic approach to minimize the risk of peritoneal  tumor-cell dissemination.&nbsp; Several recent  publications stress the need for extreme caution and a very low threshold for  conversion to an open procedure if an attempted laparoscopic procedure requires  tumor manipulation for exposure or removal.46-48&nbsp; Until better preoperative tools are developed  to detect ACC vs. ACA, it is prudent to approach all pediatric ACT with open  adrenalectomy. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intraoperative manual palpation of  the vena cava should precede tumor manipulation, as should assessment of  regional lymph nodes.&nbsp; A cardiothoracic  surgeon may assist in the rare need for thoracoabdominal approach if there is  suspicion of supradiaphragmatic tumor thrombus.&nbsp;  Lymph node dissection inferior to the ipsilateral renal vein and  superior to the iliac bifurcation has been advocated in large tumors or in the  presence of lympadenopathy, although its effect on outcome has not been  formally evaluated.41&nbsp;  Aggressive resection of distant disease is recommended when it can be  safely undertaken, as it is generally espoused that complete excision can  achieve remission.41,49-50 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staging ACT in children has been  modified by some authors to include tumor size, as it is considered to be an  independent variable in predicting disease control.&nbsp; The adult staging system for ACT is usually  the modified MacFarlane which is based on tumor size, lymph nodes and  metastasis.51&nbsp; Michalkiewicz  et al38 used a modified staging system for pediatric ACT as reported  in 2004:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>stage I: complete excision,  negative margins, tumor weight &le;200 g</li>
    <li>stage II: complete excision,  negative margins, tumor weight &ge;200 g</li>
    <li>stage III: residual or  inoperable tumor</li>
    <li>stage IV: hematogenous  metastasis at presentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong><em>Chemotherapy</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent retrospective  report in adult ACC suggested improved survivability in patients who received  adjuvant mitotane therapy.52&nbsp;  Most preceding reports had published partial response rates between 15%  and 60% in the adult population.&nbsp; Ribeiro  and colleagues treated 32 pediatric patients between 1990 and 1995 with  mitotane as adjuvant therapy.41&nbsp;  About 50% of the children relapsed after surgical therapy.&nbsp; The authors noted significant toxicity with  the agent and emphasized the need for control of the iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency  created with mitotane therapy. In 2006, Zancanella and associates reported the  use of mitotane with cisplatin, etoposide and doxorubicin.53&nbsp; There were 5 reported partial responses and 2  cases of remission in 11 patients with only three patients alive at time of  report. There is an ongoing international trial (FIRM-ACT) (www.firm-act.org)  to determine the efficacy of mitotane, etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin vs.  streptozotocin and mitotane in adult ACC.&nbsp;  A review of the current literature revealed no formal trials of  chemotherapeutic agents in pediatric ACT.&nbsp;  Use of mitotane with or without cytotoxic agents has been reserved for  unresectable or endstage disease in the pediatric population with response  rates ranging from 11% to 30%.54&nbsp;  Largely, there has been no report of significant effect on tumor size or  survivability in the pediatric population.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Radiotherapy</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Radiotherapy has been used  effectively for palliation, especially with bony metastases, but has not been  demonstrated to reliably control disease or affect survival.&nbsp; There has been some suggestion in the  pediatric and adult literature that radiotherapy to the site of resection in  high-risk patients (incomplete resection, microscopic residual disease) may  improve survival.55,56&nbsp; While  certainly feasible, the evidence that radiotherapy affects survival does not  exist in substantial numbers.&nbsp; It is  unlikely that properly designed clinical trials will illuminate the role of  radiotherapy any further, secondary to the small number of cases and  indications for its use in pediatric ACT.</p>
  <p><strong>Prognosis and Outcome</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, there is a 49-73% 5-year  survival rate in pediatric ACC.9,38,57&nbsp; When considering all ACT that meet pathologic  criteria of malignancy, the survivability increases.&nbsp; It has been reported in several series that  some ACT that meet pathologic criteria for malignancy, do not behave clinically  as a malignancy.&nbsp; This calls into  question the value of histopathologic tumor staging in pediatric ACT  altogether.&nbsp; When considering  preoperative tumor staging in relation to tumor size and local or distant  metastases, stage IV ACT have a dreadful prognosis, with some series reporting  survival rates of 0%.&nbsp; Tucci et al used a  preoperative staging classification wherein tumors less than 5 cm with no  evidence of metastases were stage I, tumors &gt;5 cm and no metastases were  stage II, evidence of local extension but no invasion or regional nodes were  stage III and any tumor with distant metastases or local invasion was stage  IV.&nbsp; Using this classification, tumor  stage was the single most important factor in prognosis with 5-year survival  overall of 59% (20/34), stage I 100% (5/5n=5) and stage IV 0% (n=10). 58&nbsp; <br>
Ahmed recently proposed  presenting age as the predominate prognostic factor.59&nbsp; It was hypothesized from author data that the  infant with an ACC may have the best overall prognosis when considering all age  groups.&nbsp; Other series had reported age as  a significant factor in multivariate analysis of outcome.&nbsp; Wienecke et al found that an age of &lt;5.4  years was associated with a more favorable outcome9 and Sabbaga et  al reported an 82% survival for &lt;2 years of age compared with 29% in older  children.6&nbsp; <br>
Sabbaga and colleagues did not detect a significant association of  tumor size and outcome; however, the patient population from Weineke&rsquo;s group  was broken down into three groups: group A, clinically and pathologically  benign; group B, clinically benign and pathologically malignant; group C,  clinically and pathologically malignant (Table 3).&nbsp; Average group ages were 10.6 years, 5.4 years  and 10.9 years, respectively.&nbsp; The  proposed pathologic criteria for malignancy included tumor weight &gt;400  grams, tumor size &gt;10.5 cm, extracapsular extension or invasion, presence of  tumor necrosis and greater than 15 mitoses per 20 high-power fields. </p>

  <p>Weineke and coauthors  concluded that both tumor size and weight correlated with patient outcome and  suggested that malignant criteria include a tumor size of greater than 10.5 cm  and a tumor weight of greater than 400 grams.9&nbsp; Additionally, in the series presented by  Ahmed, the average specimen weight was 30.8 grams (10-59 grams).59&nbsp; No specimens exhibited periadrenal extension  and all patients were alive without evidence of disease with follow-up ranging  from 5 months to 9.5 years. &nbsp;Age, tumor  size and weight seem to all contribute, if not independently, to  prognosis.&nbsp; Hanna and colleagues noted  significant prognostic benefit with tumor size and negative margins.12</p>
  <p>Summary<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Postoperative molecular analysis may  prove useful in prognosis as the genome is further elucidated, but currently it  seems wise to treat pediatric ACT as possessing an entire spectrum of malignant  potential with close postoperative follow-up including monthly laboratory  evaluation in the first year.&nbsp; Until more  reliable predictive factors are discovered and clinically confirmed, every  pediatric ACT should be treated as malignant.</p>
  <p><strong>PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term pheochromocytoma is used  generally to classify both intra-adrenal and extra-adrenal tumors that arise  from chromaffin cells that may be located anywhere along the sympatho-adrenal  system, including the adrenal medulla, Zuckerkandl body, paravertebral chain,  hilum of the kidney and liver, aortic bifurcation, bladder and mediatinum.60-62&nbsp; Paraganglioma (PGL) has been used by some  investigators as a term designating extra-adrenal PCC.61,62&nbsp; Herein, PCC shall designate tumor arising  from the chromaffin cells within the adrenal medulla and PGL shall designate a  tumor of chromaffin cell origin at an extra-adrenal site. &nbsp;Discussion shall proceed primarily within the  scope of PCC.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The incidence of PCC is estimated at  0.8 per 100,00063 with 10-20% occurring in children.64,65&nbsp; This would make the estimated pediatric  incidence 0.8 to 1.6 per million and this includes paraganglioma and PCC,  making the pediatric PCC a rarely encountered tumor.&nbsp; There is a slight male preponderance of  almost 2:1.61,62,65,66&nbsp; About  80% arise from the adrenal medulla (PCC) and both PCC and paragangliomas  (extr-adrenal PCC) produce catecholamines accounting for the high rate (60-90%)  of children presenting with sustained hypertension (HTN) and PCC or  paraganglioma.62&nbsp; It is  reported that approximately 40% of PCC and paragangliomas in children are  associated with known genetic mutations and 19-38% are bilateral adrenal.62</p>
  <p><strong>Genetics</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCC is known to occur with increased  frequency in the syndromes of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2(MEN-2), Von  Hippel Lindau (VHL) and can occur in 0.1-5.7% of patients with  neurofibromatosis type (NF-1).60&nbsp;  Studies continue to implicate and elucidate germline mutations in genes  encoding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase as precursors for increased  malignancy, pediatric occurrence and familial aggregations of PCC and PGL.60&nbsp; Although not pediatric specific, Erlic and Neumann  submitted a comprehensive review on familial pheochromocytoma.67&nbsp; Table 4 is an adaptation from data presented  in this review, illustrating gene and genomic location, tumor occurrence and  likelihood of malignancy with each syndrome.</p>

  <p>The  characteristics of PCC and PGL may be different, depending on which genetic  alterations are present; therefore, it seems prudent for every case of PCC and  PGL to undergo genetic consultation, testing and familial screening.&nbsp; As much as 40% of PCC may have a hereditary  basis including the paraganglioma syndromes, which, as the table illustrates,  are associated with a higher frequency of PGL.61,62,67&nbsp; Genetic characterization may become more  useful in predicting tumor behavior such as bilateral synchronous or  metachronous lesions, likelihood of malignancy and recurrence.&nbsp; As such, continued research with  collaborative, multi-institutional databases and repositories may allow patient  stratification into different risk groups.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Presentation, Diagnosis and Treatment Outcomes</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a child with a known syndrome  (Table 4) or with children in whom there is a known familial predisposition,  biochemical screening should be performed.&nbsp;  Approximately 1% of hypertensive pediatric patients will have PCC or PGL62&nbsp; Average age of presentation is 11 years and  60-90% of childhood PCC and PGL may present with HTN.62&nbsp; Recognized clinical signs and symptoms  include wide variability in 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, palpitations,  headache, sweating, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, polyuria, visual  disturbances and anxiety. One recent publication listed common presentations in  children: HTN, 64%; palpitation, 53%; headache, 47%; mass-related effects, 30%.68&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diagnosis is based on biochemical  testing and imaging.&nbsp; In appropriate  patients for screening, urinary or plasma, fractionated metanephrines  (metanephrine, normetanephrine) is considered most accurate with 100%  sensitivity reported in children.62&nbsp;  Specificity approaches 97% when considering plasma and urinary  fractionated metanephrines, which will be elevated as a result of the  chromaffin cell cytoplasm.62,69&nbsp;  It has been suggested that the physician consider plasma metanephrines  in working up the pediatric patient for PCC or PGL, as 24-hour urine collection  poses problems, specifically with potential under-collection.&nbsp; Age appropriate reference values for plasma  metanephrines, plasma catecholamines and urinary metanephrines have been  established and recommended for use in workup of the male and female pediatric  patient.70&nbsp; There seems to be  some debate about whether plasma or urine testing is preferred.&nbsp; Considering the 100% sensitivity previously  mentioned and a negligible difference in specificity, either or both can be  utilized.&nbsp; It is recommended by at least  one group of authors to obtain blood samples in the supine position.71&nbsp; In cases of minor and persistent elevations,  appropriate endocrine consultation for direction of more specific biochemical  testing is warranted.&nbsp; Imaging in  suspected PCC is usually completed after collection of sufficient biochemical,  objective data to suggest a neoplastic process.&nbsp;  Strong familial tendencies may lower the threshold for radiologic  localization.&nbsp; Whether to proceed with CT  or MRI is debated and one must consider the radiation dose with CT and the  likely need for general sedation with the MRI.&nbsp;  As previously noted, MRI may be more useful in evaluating local or  regional disease as there is potential for finer collimation.&nbsp; There is no risk of hypertensive crisis with  the use of intravenous nonionic contrast (CT) and the presence of PCC or PGL.45&nbsp; As many as 70% of PCC cases will demonstrate  high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (MRI).45&nbsp; I123 or I131 &ndash; MIBG scintigraphy has nearly  100% specificity and is particularly useful in cases of strong clinical  suspicion without CT or MRI demonstrable disease, work up of multifocal or  metastatic disease.45,62&nbsp;  Limited use of [18F] fluorodopamine and carbon 11-hydroxyephedrine PET  has been reported in adult series and may be further utilized as it is mAs noted with ACT,  the treatment and cure of PCC is dependent upon complete surgical  resection.&nbsp; Successful surgical treatment  hinges upon localization of the PCC and perioperative medical optimization of  the patients hemodynamic status.&nbsp;  Preoperative alpha-blockade has been the primary means by which  complications have been reduced.&nbsp; In a  published nearly five-decade experience, Goldstein and colleagues noted a  decrease in complications from 69% to 3% when adding preoperative treatment  with an alpha blocker.72&nbsp;  Protocols for treatment have not been specified for pediatric patients  but, in general, the use of phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin to achieve age, size  and sex adjusted normotension 7 to 14 days preoperatively.&nbsp; <br>
There are currently no official guidelines regarding when to start  or which agents should be started to achieve normotension and volume  expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding phenoxybenzamine  in children, maximum dose is 25 mg daily in twice daily dosing and adolescents  may take 40 to 100 mg/day.&nbsp; With  pediatric HTN, the dose is usually 2.5 mg twice daily and titrated to side  effects or normotension.&nbsp; It may be  useful to consider a switch to an alpha-1- blockade 2-3 days before surgery as  these agents (e.g., doxazosin) are short-acting and may decrease risk of  postoperative hypotension. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade should be used after  adequate alpha blockade has been established to avoid the risk of hypertensive  crisis from further vasoconstriction and is useful for prevention of  tachyarhythmias.&nbsp; If HTN is poorly  controlled,&nbsp; calcium channel blockers may  be considered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inadequate preoperative  expansion of blood volume may result in sudden postoperative hypotension so  some have recommended pre-operative hydration and high-salt and high-fluid  diets.&nbsp; Inhibition of catecholamine  synthesis is not routinely recommended in children but may be considered when  other agents are inadequate at achieving normotension.&nbsp; Intraoperative use of agents such as  nitroprusside and norepinephrine may be needed and should be available.61,62,73 <strong></strong>ore  available in the workup of the select pediatric patient.&nbsp; In most cases, CT or MRI with MIBG is  adequate for localization and characterization.&nbsp; <br>
Resection should  be undertaken after medical therapy and control has been optimized and is  directed toward complete resection of local and regional disease where possible  and is used in debulking for unresectable cases when feasible.&nbsp; The use of laparoscopic cortical sparing tumor  resection has been advocated, especially in cases of bilateral PCC.61&nbsp; Ludwig et al suggested this as the preferred  method of surgical resection noting feasibility, safety, decreased length of  hospital stay, time to oral intake and ambulation and 87% of patients  experiencing total resection of disease with 6 of 13 having been performed  laparoscopically.61&nbsp; <br>
Staging is usually  categorized by radiologic and surgical localization with local, regional,  metastatic designations.&nbsp; There are no  reliable histologic criteria to establish malignancy and it is unequivocally  present only in the presence of metastatic disease with rates varying from as  low as 2% to as high as 47%.62&nbsp;  Bone, liver and lung represent the most common sites of metastasis.&nbsp; <br>
Systemic therapy may be undertaken with MIBG or with conventional  chemotherapy, most commonly with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and  dacarbazine.&nbsp; With limited experience,  chemotherapy should be reserved for symptom relief or in attempt to achieve  partial response to allow resection of previously unresectable mass.&nbsp; Although there is a favorable long-term  survival rate, case series such as presented by Ciftci and colleagues emphasize  the importance of resection.65&nbsp;  Two of three patients with malignant PCC or PGL were able to undergo  incisional biopsy only and ultimately succumbed to the disease, whereas the  remaining patients had a 16-year mortality rate of 19%.&nbsp; Ludwig and associates reported a 100% overall  survival with 93% 5-year disease-free survival, attributing the positive  outcome to a low (7%) rate of malignancy and negative margins of resection in  all patients (n=15).61&nbsp;  Long-term surveillance is mandated by the reports of recurrence as many  as 14 years after successful treatment.</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCC or PGL in the pediatric patient  is rarely encountered and is almost always associated with characteristic signs  and symptoms or a familial predisposition.&nbsp;  Preoperative preparation consists of tumor localization and reversal or  control of the physiologic effects of catecholamine excess.&nbsp; Further genetic characterization and  classification may allow patient stratification into low and high risk  categories for malignancy and recurrence.&nbsp;  Surgical resection with negative margins is the cornerstone of curative  treatment and should be undertaken by experienced surgeons employing  laparoscopic or conventional open approaches.</p>
