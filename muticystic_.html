  <p>Multicystic  dysplastic kidney is the most common congenital cystic anomaly of the kidney,  characterized by multiple non-communicating cysts with minimal intervening  tissue on ultrasound scanning. By definition, the affected kidney is  non-functioning and is usually associated with an atretic ureter. </p>
  <p>Unlike other  cystic kidney diseases, such as the dominant and recessive forms of polycystic  kidney where there is a clear inherited pattern, MCDK occurs sporadically and  is far more common than previously thought as these kidneys remain clinically  undetected and asymptomatic. A rare familial form has been reported as  autosomal dominant with variable penetrance (1).</p>
  <p><strong>Embryology</strong></p>
  <p>The embryological  basis of this condition is not fully elucidated; however, several hypotheses  are presented:</p>
  <p>1. Abnormalities  of reciprocal induction between the ureteric bud and metanephric blastema is  the most popular.</p>
  <p>2. Obstruction  of the urinary tract during nephrogenesis has also been considered as a  possible cause for the development of cystic transformation of the kidney. </p>
  <p>3. In-utero  viral infections and antiepileptic medications have been implicated in some  reports (2,3). </p>
  <p><strong>Incidence</strong></p>
  <p>The  incidence is about 1 in 4000 and is more common in males (2.4:1). Females are twice  as likely to develop bilateral MCDK. The left side is more common than the  right.</p>
  <p>Unilateral  (UMCDK), bilateral (BMCDK), and segmental (SMCDK) are recognized forms of  involvement. Bilateral disease is incompatible with life.</p>
  <p><strong>Pathology</strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Macroscopy:</em></strong> On gross appearance, 2  types are described: solid cystic dysplasia and the hydronephrotic forms. The  former has smaller and fewer cysts with more stroma and the latter has cysts of  varying sizes and a recognizable but dilated renal pelvis with very little  intervening stroma. The vascular pedicle is hypoplastic or absent. The ureter  is usually atretic if present. Previously thought to be non-communicating, these  cysts have, in several studies, proven to have communications with each other  both on microscopy and radiological intracystic injections of contrast medium  (4-6)</p>
  <p><strong><em>Microscopy:</em></strong> There are components of  both abnormal (dysplastic) and normal nephrogenesis. Dysplastic elements  include primitive ducts with concentric rings of collagen, and occasional  smooth muscle cells surrounding it. Others are metaplastic cartilage, primitive  ducts and glomeruli, intervening mesenchyme and fibrous tissue. Cysts are lined  by flattened squamous or columnar epithelium that have originated from all  segments of the nephron, from glomerulus to the collecting duct.</p>
  <p><strong>Clinical Features</strong></p>
  <p>Historically,  a palpable mass per abdomen was the commonest presentation. This has been  surpassed by increasing detection on antenatal ultrasound scanning and forms  the largest group of patients currently. There is some evidence to suggest that  unilateral renal agenesis may represent an MCDK that has regressed (7). Pain or  discomfort in the flank, haematuria, UTI, and hypertension are other presentations  postnatally.</p>
  <p>Segmental  MCDK is a rare form and can occur in horseshoe kidneys and moieties of duplex  systems. A large segmental MCDK may obscure a much smaller functioning segment  where radioactive isotope study is the only method of identification.</p>
  <p>Other  ipsilateral associations that have been reported are vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR),  vesico-uereteric junction obstruction (VUJO) and ureterocoeles. In a duplex  system, a pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (PUJO) in the other moiety has  also been noted.</p>
  <p>On  the contralateral side, VUR is the most common anomaly, occurring in up to 25%;  however these cases are mostly under grade 3 reflux. Other uncommon findings  are PUJO and VUJO. </p>
  <p><strong>Investigations</strong></p>
  <p>Diagnosis  is considered by ultrasound findings demonstrating non-communicating cysts (Figure  1.1) with very little intervening parenchyma. It may be confirmed by absence of  uptake on radio-isotope scanning such as a Tc99m-DMSA or Tc99m-MAG3  scan. </p>
  <p>The  conditions that mimic MCDK include severe intrarenal hydronephrosis due to a pelvi-ureteric  junction obstruction(Figures 1.2, 1.3). The latter condition usually has some  intervening and surrounding parenchyma, communicating cysts on ultrasound with  some uptake on the radioisotope scan. Others include a cystic nephroma (Figure  2.1), though this is rare and difficult to distinguish from segmental MCDK, and  may MRI for identification. (Figure 2.2). In some cases a percutaneous or  excisional biopsy may be necessary.</p>
  <p>Cystograms  are unnecessary in isolated MCDK with a normal contralateral kidney. Obtaining  a glomerular filtration rate is recommended as a baseline and to confirm the  function of the contralateral kidney.</p>
  <p><strong>Management</strong></p>
  <p>A uniform approach  in the management of MCDK has not been universally established; however various  aspects need consideration, namely spontaneous involution, risk of  hypertension, vesico-ureteric reflux, risk of cancer and follow-up protocols.</p>
  <p>A comprehensive  literature review was conducted by Cambio et al in 2008 and forms the basis of  discussion to guide management outlined below (8). This review included the  analysis of 105 publications and data on another 900 MCDKs from the MCDK  Registry (9). Outcomes studied were vesico-ureteric reflux, hypertension,  malignancy and need for surgery. </p>
  <p>Overall,  involution&mdash;defined as being undetectable by ultrasound&mdash;was noted in 60%; 20%  were undetectable by 3 years and 50% by 5 years. Vesico-ureteric reflux  occurred in 25%, but this was into the contralateral kidney and more than 90%  were grade 3 or less. The risk of urinary tract infection was related to reflux  or abnormalities other than the MCDK. Compared to the general population, there  was no increased risk of hypertension; however, this may be considered to be an  indication for removal. In more than two-thirds, hypertension persists despite  surgical removal.</p>
  <p>In  1997, Beckwith et al reported the calculated the risk of Wilms tumor in MCDK as  less than 1 in 2000 (10). Noe et al came to the same conclusion quite independently  with a number needed to treat as 2000 to prevent the occurrence of one Wilms  tumor (11). Wacksmann and Phipps in their preliminary report on the MCDK  Registry recorded only 2 Wilms tumors spanning a 25-year period (9).</p>
  <p>There were 10  reported cases of Wilms tumor in the review and all were before the age of four  (8). Seven of the 10 presented with a palpable mass. There has been no reported Wilms in an involuted MCDK. There were 6 reports of renal cell carcinoma  (RCC) associated with MCDK between 15 and 44 years of age. However, the accuracy  of pathology is debatable as these were not subjected to external pathology  review as with Wilms tumors. It is possible that some were cystic RCCs. There  were no cases of Wilms tumor from the published data of the MCDK Registry,  which included 260 cases managed non-operatively. The same inference was  gathered from the prospective data collected by the Trent &amp; Anglia MCDK  Study Group (12).</p>
  <p><strong>Indications for Surgery</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Large  MCDK causing abdominal distension, discomfort, pain or respiratory compromise in  the first few months of life<br>
    </li>
    <li>Tumors  that continue to increase in size<br>
    </li>
    <li>Hypertension<br>
    </li>
    <li>Failure  to regress is considered by some as a relative indication for surgery<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>There are no  predictive factors to determine spontaneous resolution. There are some  anecdotal reports to suggest that a size of greater than 6 centimeters at one  year of age is unlikely to resolve spontaneously. Up to 40% of MCDKs were still  being followed beyond the age of 10 (Figure 1.0). </p>
  <p>A clear  discussion with the family should be explored in select cases with the offer of  removal as this is curative, with low morbidity and is cost-effective without  the anxiety of ongoing surveillance. A progressively decreasing size&nbsp; can be clearly managed non-operatively.</p>
  <p>There are no  clear guidelines with regard to surveillance; however, it seems unnecessary  beyond the age of four for malignancy. </p>
  <p>Surgical removal  of MCDK can be accomplished by both conventional open and laparoscopic techniques.  Large MCDKs may need cysts decompressed to facilitate removal. Both trans-peritoneal  and retro-peritoneoscopic approaches are well established techniques. Follow-up  after surgery maybe up to a year and include an ultrasound and serum creatinine  from which an estimated glomerular filtration rate can be obtained. Routine GFR  measurements are probably unnecessary in the absence of any underlying risk  factors (13).</p>
  <p><strong>Summary points</strong></p>
  <ol>
  <ul>
    <li>It  is the commonest congenital cystic anomaly of the kidney.</li>
    <li>The  most popular embryological basis is abnormalities of reciprocal induction  between the ureteric bud and metanephric blastema.</li>
    <li>It  is characterized by multiple cysts showing no radio-isotope uptake on nuclear  medicine scanning and the ureter is usually atretic.</li>
    <li>Cystograms  are unnecessary in the presence of a normal contralateral kidney.</li>
    <li>Spontaneous  involution occurs in more than two-thirds.</li>
    <li>The  risk of hypertension, malignancy, urinary tract infection and vesico-ureteric  reflux is too low to justify routine removal of these malformed kidneys.</li>
    <li>In  more than two-thirds, hypertension persists despite removal.</li>
    <li>Open,  laparoscopic and retro-peritoneoscopic approaches are well established  techniques with minimal morbidity and should be discussed with family in select  cases as an alternative.</li>
    <li>Long-term  follow-up following removal in the absence of underlying risk factors is  unnecessary.<br>
